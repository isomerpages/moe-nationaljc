Started in 2007, the student exchange programme between National Junior College (NJC) and Chu Van An High School (CVAHS) in Vietnam aims to: 
  
*  extend the studentsâ€™ network of friends internationally and develop positive relationships between students of both countries; 
* allow the students to learn from each other, and cultivate an inquisitive mind and critical thinking skills; and  
* provide opportunities for the students to inspire and motivate others to understand the history, economy, culture and society of Singapore and Vietnam after this programme.
