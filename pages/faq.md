### FAQs about IP DSA (Sec)

<u><b>Admissions and Intake</b></u>

**How many students does NJC enrol in each Junior High cohort?**

_There are around 200 students in each Junior High cohort._

**Is NJC affiliated with any Primary school for better chances of entry?**&nbsp;

_No, NJC is not affiliated to any Primary or Secondary school._&nbsp;&nbsp;

<u><b>School Structure and Processes</b></u>

**How are incoming JH1 students allocated to classes?**&nbsp;&nbsp;

_There is a good mix of students with different gifts/talents, interests, races, and backgrounds in each class. It is important that NJCians value diversity and learn to harness the synergy this offers. These are fundamental to a rich learning experience. There are usually between 26 – 29 students in a JH class. There are 7 JH1 classes._&nbsp;&nbsp;

**What time does school start and end for Junior High students?**&nbsp;&nbsp;

_Students report to school by 7:40 am each day, except on Thursdays where they report to school by 8:40 am. The core curriculum usually ends by 2:00 pm. This provides students sufficient time to explore a range of other interests, which includes academic electives (e.g. 3rd Languages, Art Elective Programme, Music Programme, Advanced Inquiry in Mathematics, Advanced Sciences, Man &amp; Ideas, etc.), CCAs, interest groups, and various seminars and competitions._

**Does NJC have a school bus option to ferry students from their homes to school? Where can we get the contact?**&nbsp;&nbsp;

_No, NJC does not have a school bus service. Our students’ parents make their own arrangements to ensure that their children arrive in school punctually and safely._&nbsp;&nbsp;

**What time does the school side gate near the bus stop open and close?**&nbsp;

_The gate adjacent to the bus stop along Dunearn Road allows students to enter the College via the Sports Complex. This gate is opened from 6:00 am to 7:40 am (and 8:40 am on Thursdays) each morning, and from 12:00 pm to 10:00 pm in the afternoons/evenings. The gate is accessible from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm on Saturdays. Access via this gate is done electronically using registered EZ-Link cards.&nbsp;(These timings may be adjusted according to the college calendar.)_

**How much do I have to pay for my child’s school fees?**&nbsp;&nbsp;

_The fees payable is dependent on your child’s nationality/citizenship. Please check&nbsp;[https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/fees](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/fees)&nbsp;for the latest information on school fees._

_Please also note that there are financial aid schemes for Singapore Citizens. You may refer to&nbsp;[https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance)&nbsp;to find out more._

**What are NJC students’ learning experiences like? Is there a lot of homework?**&nbsp;

_Junior High students generally learn in subject class groups, with occasional mass lectures at the Upper JH levels. They are exposed to a variety of learning tools and resources, and are trained to use print and non-print media for information or knowledge processing. They also make presentations of their ideas to their classmates and embark on projects, both written and oral. There is room for them to grow their thinking skills, subject-specific content and skills, oral skills, people skills, time management skills, self-management and leadership competencies._&nbsp;&nbsp;

_There could be more homework than what your children experienced in Primary school because Secondary level students have more subjects. There is also work (like projects) that spans a longer period of time._&nbsp; &nbsp;

**Are electives like Man &amp; Ideas, Advanced Science, Advanced Inquiry in Mathematics (AIM), Python Electives, Advanced Language Arts, Advanced Humanities, etc. compulsory?**&nbsp;&nbsp;

_These are electives offered at JH3 (except for AIM which is offered in JH1). The IP curriculum, in and of itself, extends beyond base requirements of a core secondary or high school curriculum. Enrichment and deeper learning are therefore an integral part of the IP curriculum._&nbsp;&nbsp;

_Students who show the interest and capacity will have the opportunity to enjoy these extensions in their areas of strength, to deepen their inquiry and interest in specific knowledge &amp; skills domains._&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Is Higher Mother Tongue compulsory?**&nbsp;&nbsp;

_All students who have received a letter from MOE stating that they are eligible to offer Higher Mother Tongue should offer the subject._

_However, a child can qualify for NJC without having to qualify to read Higher Mother Tongue. Arrangements will be made to support his/her learning of Mother Tongue at the appropriate level._

_Student has to obtain at least a ‘C’ grade if he/she is to continue reading Higher Mother Tongue in JH3 and JH4. Students who read Higher Chinese but wish to change to G3 CL may do so at the end of JH2._&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Is Higher Mother Tongue O-level Examination to be taken in JH4?**

_Yes, all students who read Higher Mother Tongue will attempt the O-level Higher Mother Tongue Examination. They will meet the minimum requirement of the University admission once they pass the Examination with at least a ‘D’ grade._

_For those who are reading Express Mother Tongue, they will offer H1 Mother Tongue in Senior High 1 (JC1) and need to obtain an ‘S’ pass to fulfil the minimum requirement for University admission._

**Does NJC conduct any MOE Third Language programme in-house?**&nbsp;

_No, NJC does not conduct any MOE Third Language programme in-house. All MOE Third Language programme students will travel to their respective language centres after school on specific days for their lessons, tests and examinations._

**How should my child schedule her Third Language lessons?**&nbsp;&nbsp;

_Third language lessons are conducted at the MOE Language Centres, usually from about 3:00 pm. For logistical and operational reasons, we strongly encourage that your child schedules her Third Language lessons on either Tuesday or Thursday._&nbsp;

**Are Hindi classes conducted in-house at NJC?**&nbsp;&nbsp;

_Hindi classes, like all Non-Tamil Indian Languages (NTIL), are conducted at a language centre. NTIL classes are&nbsp;not&nbsp;conducted at NJC._&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Does NJC have a special class for students from the GEP stream?**&nbsp;

_No. However, NJC makes provisions for developing students’ talents in different academic areas. There are special programmes, such as Advanced Inquiry in Mathematics, Advanced Science, Advanced Language Arts and Advanced Humanities, which cater for students who show aptitude in these areas and are ready to be stretched in terms of content and skills in the discipline. There are also Research opportunities, with mentoring done by field experts, beyond the core JH2-3 exploratory research module (i.e. the Special Programme in Inquiry and REsearch, or SPIRE). Those with artistic gifts can apply for the MOE Art Elective Programme at NJC or the NJC Music Programme at JH1._&nbsp;

**Are there GEP students in NJC, and what programmes are there for them?**&nbsp;&nbsp;

_Yes, there are GEP students in the NJC community and they are identified just like other students for further development in their areas of strength. The provisions may be organised by the subject teacher or may be part of the structured experiences stated above._&nbsp;

**What can my child do if he encounters difficulties in his academic learning?**&nbsp;&nbsp;

_Students in NJC should always feel able to seek help. NJC teachers support their students’ learning in class by giving them opportunities to ask questions and clarify doubts during lessons as well as outside of curriculum hours by arranging appointments with students. They may also have additional online resources made available to their students. Furthermore, there are structured consolidation time slots allocated to each subject and level to help identified students learn well._&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**What does assessment in NJC look like?**&nbsp;&nbsp;

_At NJC, we view assessment as a means to find out how much the child has learnt, and to inform both the student and the teacher on the next stage of learning. In keeping with our philosophy and principles of assessment, your child would be mentored to demonstrate learning of knowledge and skills through a wide range of modes. These include research projects, performance tasks, integrated assignments and of course, pen-and-paper tests._&nbsp;&nbsp;

**What must my child achieve in order to be promoted or to progress to the next level?**&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>For promotion to the next level, JH1 and 2 students should attain an overall score of 50% and pass the following 5 subjects: Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, History/Geography and 1 more subject.</i>

**There is no O-Level cohort at NJC. What would happen to my child if he/she is not able to cope with the IP?**&nbsp;&nbsp;

_We will take care of every child. Learning is personalised and differentiated to ensure that all learners are able to optimise the learning experience. In a similar vein, every learner is supported to ensure that learning gaps are addressed in a timely manner and that the learner rebuilds confidence._&nbsp;&nbsp;

_There have been instances where a child and his/her parents feel that another education track is more appropriate. We have facilitated the necessary and continued to monitor the growth and progress of the child. These children have done very well for themselves._&nbsp;

**<u>CCAs&nbsp;</u>**

**What CCAs can a JH1 student join?**&nbsp;

_All JH1 students experience the unique Co-curricular Activities for Exposure (CAFÉ) programme in their first year, where they will undergo the experiences of both Sports &amp; Games and Performing Arts CCAs. This will help them make an informed decision in their choice of CCA for their remaining JH years. Please note that there are no Uniformed Groups at NJC._&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

_Students who are admitted via the DSA-Sec exercise must commit to their CCA of choice for four years. They may join another CCA in Senior High if they choose to._

<i>JH1 students will experience the six Junior High Sports &amp; Games and nine Performing Arts CCAs during their Orientation week. This will help them make an informed decision in their choice of CCA for their remaining JH years. 

Only the 15 Junior High CCAs are opened to Junior High students and you can check them out at this <a href="/co-curricular-activities/overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>. There are no Uniformed Groups at NJC. 
	
Students who are admitted via the DSA-Sec exercise through a CCA must commit to their CCA for four years. They may join another CCA in Senior High if they choose to. </i>

**How many CCAs can students take up?**&nbsp;

_Most students from JH will follow MOE guidelines to take up one core CCA activity, often a sport or one of the performing arts. There are some students, with the consent of their parents and teachers, who also join a second CCA, often a club or society where they pursue other non-sports or performing arts interests. On top of their CCAs, JH students with a passion to lead also serve the student community as members of the Student Council or as Peer Support Leaders._&nbsp;&nbsp;

**<u>Research@NJC</u>**

**What research opportunities does NJC provide?**

_All JH students will read the Special Programme in Inquiry and REsearch (SPIRE). SPIRE starts in the second half of JH2. Your child will be introduced to the basics of research, specifically to learn how to read academic papers, understand the knowledge creation process, develop capacity in asking and framing research questions and write a research proposal. Your child is free to explore any academic field (Sciences, Mathematics, Sport Science, Humanities or Language Arts) and will be mentored by a teacher who has expertise in that field. In JH3, your child will continue with what he/she had previously proposed, e.g. conduct experiments, develop models and simulations, administer investigative surveys, etc. The SPIRE experience culminates with a Symposium at the end of JH3._&nbsp;&nbsp;

_Your child could also choose to further his/her research experience by participating in the College’s Science Training &amp; Research (STaR) Programme. This programme affords your child the opportunity to work with research scientists at various academic (e.g. NUS, NTU, SUTD), research institutes (e.g. A\*STAR) institutes and industry partners under the guidance of professional academics or principal investigators. Further to this, your child would also have the opportunity to participate in research exchange programmes with various high schools from Singapore and around the world (e.g. Australia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, United Kingdom) in various fields (Sciences, Mathematics, Sport Science, Humanities or Language Arts)._&nbsp;&nbsp;

_All research students have the opportunity to present their work at various platforms, ranging from local &amp; international fairs to academic conferences. Research exchange programmes are available for JH3-SH1 students. Finally, students may choose to read research as a Higher 3 (H3) subject when in Senior High._

**<u>DSA (Sec)-Specific Questions</u>**

**How do I apply for DSA? How many choices can I make? Is there an application fee?**&nbsp;

_All applications must be submitted through the online DSA-Sec Portal. Applications are free-of-charge.&nbsp;Applicants only need to fill in one online form to apply to multiple schools._

_Applicants may indicate up to 3 choices and 3 talent areas. You may indicate up to 2 talent areas for the same school. If you want to apply for 2 talent areas at the same school, you must indicate both as separate choices._&nbsp;

_Please refer to the MOE website:_&nbsp;[www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec](http://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec)&nbsp;_for more details._&nbsp;

**How many students has NJC admitted via DSA over the last few years?**&nbsp;&nbsp;

_NJC has admitted about 25-30% of the cohort via DSA over the last 5 years._

**Is there a quota or fixed number of places for any specific talent area?**&nbsp;

_There is no quota for the number of DSA places set aside for any one talent area._&nbsp;&nbsp;

**What is the PSLE score requirement for a student accepted via DSA?**&nbsp;

_As long as the student meets the PSLE cut-off for Posting Group 3 as set by MOE (i.e. AL 22), the student can be admitted to NJC via DSA._&nbsp;

**If my child is unable to cope with or loses interest in the talent area, can he/she stop participating in that area and/or opt to pursue another area of interest instead?**

_Students who are successfully admitted via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for throughout Junior High (i.e. Years 1 – 4)._&nbsp;

_However, in Senior High (i.e. Years 5 – 6), all students — irrespective of their DSA status — are allowed to opt to either continue with participation in the same CCAs or special programmes, or to explore other areas of interest._&nbsp;&nbsp;

**If I am successful under the DSA, can I opt for a school transfer after the release of the PSLE results, or in subsequent years?**&nbsp;&nbsp;

_Students who are successfully admitted via the DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school for the duration of the six-year Integrated Programme. Please note that your child will strictly not be allowed to submit school choices during the Secondary 1 (S1) posting process, or transfer to another school throughout the six years. They must commit to their chosen school for the duration of the programme._&nbsp;

**When will the results of the DSA application be announced?**&nbsp;

_All successful applicants will be informed of the outcome — Confirmed Offer, Waiting List, or Unsuccessful — by 11 Sep 2023._

_Students given a Confirmed Offer are guaranteed a place in the school, provided that they accept the offer via the DSA-Sec Portal between 23 Oct – 27 Oct 2023, and qualify for Posting Group 3 based on their PSLE results._

**If I am unsuccessful under the DSA, how else can I gain admission to NJC?**&nbsp;

_Primary 6 students can apply through the Secondary One Posting Exercise conducted by MOE after the release of the PSLE results, provided that they have not already accepted a DSA offer from another secondary school._

**<u>Music Programme &amp; Art Elective Programme (AEP)</u>**

**What does Music Programme or AEP mean?**

_Music Programme or AEP is offered as an academic programme where students who are admitted to either of these programmes are required to read Music or Art as part of their academic curriculum. It is mandatory for students who are in the Music Programme or AEP to attend the curriculum lessons which take place on weekday afternoons._

**If my child is admitted to Music Programme or AEP DSA, can he/she not have a CCA?**

_We believe that CCA is an important aspect of your child’s holistic development, hence it is important that your child is exposed to other areas of development and interaction with other students from other backgrounds and interests. All Music Programme and AEP DSA students are expected to take up a CCA_.&nbsp;

**If my child is admitted to Music Programme DSA, must he/she be in a music-related CCA?**

_As your child’s commitment is to the academic programme, he/she is free to choose to join any CCA that is offered to all Junior High students, be it from Sports &amp; Games or the Performing Arts._
