### Malay Language Elective Programme

2020 was a memorable year for NJC as we were appointed the newest Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) centre (along with Raffles Institution) by the Ministry of Education (MOE), joining the ranks of three other centres. The pioneer cohort consists of ten students, of whom five are scholars awarded the MLEP scholarship by MOE.

Signature modules such as Introduction to Translation, Malay Song Appreciation and Movie Appreciation were developed in-house and conducted during MLEP sessions. These modules are designed with the purpose of further enhancing students' proficiency in ML and deepening their love for the culture, through activities such as role-playing as translators representing different fields.

These students will in turn be our language and cultural ambassadors who will bring the language and culture to greater heights in years to come.
