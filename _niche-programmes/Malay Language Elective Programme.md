### Malay Language Elective Programme

2020 was a memorable year for NJC as we were appointed the newest Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) centre (along with Raffles Institution) by the Ministry of Education (MOE), joining the ranks of three other centres. The pioneer cohort consists of ten students, of whom five are scholars awarded the MLEP scholarship by MOE.

Signature modules such as Introduction to Translation, Malay Song Appreciation and Movie Appreciation were developed in-house and conducted during MLEP sessions. These modules are designed with the purpose of further enhancing students' proficiency in ML and deepening their love for the culture, through activities such as role-playing as translators representing different fields.

These students will in turn be our language and cultural ambassadors who will bring the language and culture to greater heights in years to come.

In 2019, NJC was one of 2 Junior Colleges selected to offer the Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) and Tamil Language Elective Programme (TLEP). Both programmes are meant for students who are highly competent in Malay and Tamil to pursue their passion in the respective languages. For MLEP, our niche programmes are Translation and Malay Music. Signature activities such as Introduction to Translation, Lyric Writing Workshops and Malay Music Appreciation are conducted with the purpose of further enhancing students’ bilingual prowess and deepening their love for the language and culture. As for TLEP, the wide range of modules offered such as Movies and Songs Appreciation, Poetry Workshop, Short Story Penning Workshop have encouraged students to explore individual interests, the chance to explore new options, allowing them to study more about the subject they are passionate about, and has enabled them to ‘test drive’ new activities.
