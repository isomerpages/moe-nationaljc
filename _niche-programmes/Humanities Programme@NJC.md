### Humanities Programme @ NJC

The NJC Humanities Programme is a stretch programme for students passionate about the Humanities and consists of:

*   [Advanced Humanities (AH)](https://nationaljc.moe.edu.sg/curriculum/junior-high-integrated-programme/subjects-offered-in-junior-high/advanced-humanities/), a 2 year programme in JH3-4 and
*   The Humanities Integrated Programme (HIP), a 15-month programme in SH1-2. 

 **We seek to nurture inspirational Humanities thought leaders who are proactive in serving the community.**

The Humanities Programme provides opportunities for students to:

*   **Explore** an interdisciplinary humanities curriculum, with humanities research elements;
*   **Enrich** themselves through interaction with experts and peers at external conferences, workshops, competitions, internships, international exchanges and learning journeys, as participants, presenters and co-designers; and
*   **Empower** themselves through collaborative leadership development opportunities and knowledge-based service projects.
