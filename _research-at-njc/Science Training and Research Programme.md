### Science Training and Research (STaR) Programme

<img src="/images/star1.png" 
     style="width:40%">

The Science Training and Research (STaR) Programme is the flagship programme of Research@NJC.

A natural step forward upon the completion of the SPIRE programme, students can extend their learning and further their research interest under the programmes offered under the STaR Programme. The programmes under the STaR programme are either local research programmes or overseas research programmes.

These programmes are available for Junior High 3 to Senior High 1 IP students, and also Senior High 1 JAE students.

Senior High 1 students who are keen to explore a career as a researcher can take on the opportunity of reading research as an ‘A’ Level H3 subject under the H3 STaR Programme.

Details on these programmes can be found below.

H3-STaR students work independently on a research project together with A\*STAR scientists over a period of 7 months, and will write and defend their thesis at a viva in their graduating year. </p>

The Enrichment Science Training and Research Programme is a natural extension from SPIRE. More advanced techniques and methods, deeper concepts and work with more extensive impact are the hallmarks of the STaR Programme. Programmes within E-STaR include the International Research Exchange Programme (IREP), Industrial Research in Environment Attachment Programme (IREAP) and the Institute-Based. </p>

SRP is a NUS outreach programmes for SH1 students. Students get to work on research projects in  
Life/Medical Sciences, Chemical/Physical Sciences, and Engineering under the guidance of  
mentors from NUS and established research centres. Similarly, students undertake at least 8 months of research activities.  This programme will culminate in the submission of a Research Paper and a Poster Presentation carried out during the SRP Congress, held in April annually.

SH1 Students can choose to enrol in either the H3 NUS SRP (examinable) or the enrichment version (non-examinable).

_Application opens in late Jan/early Feb._

[**SUTD Research Mentorship Programme (RMP)**](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Outreach)

SUTD offers research project opportunities and provides mentorship to SH1 every year under RMP.

**Overseas Research Programmes** 

NJC has eight established IREPs across six different countries. Every IREP offers students the distinctive opportunity of collaborating on a research project with peers from another country, while also immerse themselves in another culture via homestays of their peers. NJC students also get the opportunity to be ambassadors of Singapore and the College by extending their warm hospitality when their peers from another country visits Singapore to work on the research project. This cross-culture research exchange helps broadens perspectives of research and also deepens the global awareness of NJC students. The subject areas of research available in IREP includes Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics and the Humanities.
