The Science Training and Research (STaR) Programme is the flagship programme of Research@NJC.

A natural step forward upon the completion of the SPIRE programme, students can extend their learning and further their research interest under the programmes offered under the STaR Programme. The programmes under the STaR programme are either local research programmes or overseas research programmes.

These programmes are available for Junior High 3 to Senior High 1 IP students, and also Senior High 1 JAE students.

Senior High 1 students who are keen to explore a career as a researcher can take on the opportunity of reading research as an ‘A’ Level H3 subject under the H3 STaR Programme.

Details on these programmes can be found below.
