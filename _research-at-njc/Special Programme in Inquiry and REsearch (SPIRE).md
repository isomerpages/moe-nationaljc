Specialised Programme in Inquiry and Research (SPIRE) is our signature programme under Research@NJC where students conduct their self-designed critical inquiry project under the mentorship of a teacher mentor in specialised disciplines (e.g. material science, computational science, mathematical modelling and product design) within the Sciences, Mathematics, Humanities and Social Sciences, and Innovation.

SPIRE is conducted in 3 phases â€“ Research Design Phase, Experimentation Phase and Communication Phase. Through this programme, students gain invaluable learning opportunities in crafting a research problem via close analysis of the knowledge schema in a particular academic field through critical reading of existing literature, designing feasible experimental protocol and actualising their plans through collaborative experimental work. Students will culminate their SPIRE journey through a formal professional presentation and a thesis report of their work to their peers and a wider audience.
