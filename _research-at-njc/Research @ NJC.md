One of the cornerstones of the College,&nbsp;Research@NJC enables students the complete academic experience.

By offering research in Science, Mathematics, Computing, Sports Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences, students have access to a wide array of opportunities to develop their interest and deepen their learning. From learning the ropes of research in College, to working with international scientists at local research and academic institutes, and to collaborating with peers from high schools from around the world, our students are closely mentored by NJC teachers and empowered to be independent learners.

With these rich experiences, Research@NJC students are articulate, critical in thought, effective academic collaborators, resilient in learning and serving the world that they live in.
