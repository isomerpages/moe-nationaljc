##### Junior High (JH)

**1\. How does JH Music Programme offered at NJC differ from ‘O’ Level Music?**  
The NJC Music Programme is designed with an emphasis on Aural Perception, Music Writing, Performing and Practical Musicianship skills to cultivate critical thinking, listening and musicianship skills in students. ‘O’ Level music is more broad-based in its syllabus coverage whereas the NJC Music Programme allows for inter-disciplinary study in JH1, and specialization in Western European music from JH2-JH4.

**2\. Do students need to take up a second instrument for the music practical exam?**  
No. This is not compulsory, though it is one of the options to fulfill the requirements of the music practical exam. Potential JH1 students are highly encouraged to consider the 2nd instrumental scheme.

**3\. Will students be able to drop out of the course if they don’t wish to continue**?  
There will be a one month trial period, following which, students will be asked to sign a two-year contract binding them to the music programme. They will not be allowed to drop until the end of JH2 when they can decide whether to renew the contract for another two years. Please note that the trial period does not apply if students DSA into the college via the music programme; DSA students who enter the college via the music programme will have to complete the entire 4-year junior high music course.

**4\. How do Piano Ensemble and String Ensemble fit together with NJC’s CAFE CCA programme for its JH1 students?**  
NJC typically requires its JH1 students to join ‘niche’ CCAs in their 1st year at college as part of the compulsory CAFE CCA programme. Piano Ensemble and String Ensemble are not considered niche CCAs; however, students extremely proficient on their instruments are invited to audition. Exceptionally talented students will be put on the Talent Management Scheme, which exempts them from the CAFE programme and allows them to join either Piano or Strings Ensemble instead.

**5\. Do the students sit for the ‘O’ level music paper at the end of the JH programme?**  
No. The NJC music programme is not equivalent to the Music Elective Programme (MEP). Students will sit for NJC’s own internal examination at the end of the JH programme. Those who do well are encouraged to continue pursuing music as an A level subject in their Senior High years.

##### Senior High (SH)

**1\. What Music papers do NJC offer and at which level?**  
NJC offers H2 Music. ‘A’ Level Music is offered only at H2 and H3 level. NJC will be exploring H3 in the future.

**2\. How does ‘A’ Level Music differ from ‘O’ Level Music?**  
‘O’ Level Music is more broad-based in its coverage, whereas the ‘A’ Level Music syllabus covers greater depth. For example, ‘O’ Level Music covers multiple Western-European genres and six world-music cultures, while the ‘A’ Level Music focuses on one Western topic (genre or period specific) and two world music cultures. The Composition component in ‘A’ Level also goes beyond 18th Century two-part writing to include modern compositional techniques.
