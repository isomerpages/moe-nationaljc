**Zeitmusik’18**

Once again, the NJC Music Programme is proud to present Zeitmusik, our annual concert featuring music students from all 6 levels in a wide variety of musical genres and ensembles. This year’s programme promises a particularly eclectic mix, including the exotic strains of the likes of the Armenian Rhapsody, a rarely played piano trio by the French composer Tailleferre, the tuneful modernism of English composer Ferguson and the edgier one of the German Hindemith and good old classics by Bach on the oboe, and a Schubert quartet. The programme also features improvised music in the style of rock/jazz, complete with drumset and electronic keyboards, and two world premieres: Cao Yufei’s (2016-7) composition, Unfolding for two pianos, and a piece based on Carnatic rhythmic syllables, written by Ms Denise Lee. Two of our music teachers will also be performing a duo for this concert!

The details of the concert are:

Date: 13 Aug 2018  
Time: 7.30pm  
Price: $15  
Venue: Esplanade Recital Studio

See you there!
