##### Direct School Admission (DSA) to JC Programme for Sec 4 students

The Direct School Admission (DSA) allows students with special talents and achievements to apply to our College directly. The DSA Exercise usually takes place in May. Students who are successful will be guaranteed a place, provided they meet the eligibility criteria for admission into NJC based on their GCE O Level results. Students admitted under DSA will not take part in the JAE in 2013. Students may apply through the **Music Excellence Category (MuE)**, as long as they fulfill the criteria below:

*   Excellence in Music, and offers Music as an ‘O’ Level subject
*   Good secondary school academic track records
*   Must offer H2 Music at ‘A’ Level upon entrance to NJC

Students may also appeal through the Music Excellence Category during the Joint Admission Exercise (JAE).
