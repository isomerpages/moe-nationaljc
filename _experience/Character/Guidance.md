### Guidance

**Education and Career Guidance**

**Partnerships, and Education and Career Guidance**

National Junior College (NJC) prepares its students holistically to be ready for higher education as well as to tackle the challenges that they will meet after leaving NJC. Students need to have access to accurate and timely information regarding their options for higher education (both locally and abroad) before they make decisions that have implications on their next phase of learning and their lives.

The NJC Partnerships and Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Team provides our students the required support for them to know more about the various courses and universities that they can enrol in. The team is active in establishing and maintaining viable relationships with NJC’s various partners, such as the local Autonomous Universities (AUs), international universities, scholarship boards and admissions administrators.

Some resources and avenues of support NJCians can consider include:

\-The MySkillsFuture portal [https://www.myskillsfuture.sg/content/student/en/secondary/about/myskillsfuture-for-students.html](https://www.myskillsfuture.sg/content/student/en/secondary/about/myskillsfuture-for-students.html)

\-ECG Counsellor

\-ECG Lessons

\-University talks

\-Career and Scholarships Fair

\-Outreach efforts by various partner universities and potential employers

and a dedicated ECG centre in our Buzz room (next to the library)
