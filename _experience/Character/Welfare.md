**Student Welfare and Counselling**

NJC adopts a ‘strength-based’ approach towards students’ holistic well-being.

To lead with sensitivity and to serve with honour, a leader must be of sound character.  To this end, the Student Welfare and Counselling Teams work closely with personal mentors and other committees in the pastoral care of our students, guided by MOE’s Social Emotional Learning.

If you would like to find out more about our initiatives or to speak with our team, you may visit our counselling portal (with some online self-help resources) or contact any one of us:
