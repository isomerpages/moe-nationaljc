### Character

**Character and Citizenship Education**

The NJC Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is a deliberate effort to imbue core ethical values and create authentic learning experiences through a series of tiered academic and non-academic programmes.

Given that the world is increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA), CCE aims to develop 21st Century skills in our students so that they are able to be discerning and chart their next course of action based on sound moral values. Through discussions of contemporary issues in class, the team seeks to develop students to be concerned citizens.
