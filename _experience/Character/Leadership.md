### Leadership

**Student Leadership and Development**

Our approach to developing our leaders is based on the concept of Servant Leadership, first proposed by Robert K. Greenleaf in 1970. The principle behind this approach is for our leaders to think of themselves as being in service of those they seek to lead, for the benefit, growth, and empowerment of the community which they belong to.

NJCians are encouraged to step up and explore opportunities to develop their leadership skills across various contexts and in service to groups of varying sizes. Some of these avenues in place which NJCians can consider include:
