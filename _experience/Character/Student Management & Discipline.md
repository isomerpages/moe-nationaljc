### Student Management &amp; Discipline

<b>NJC’s Framework</b>

  

In NJC, it is expected that students exercise responsible decision making and evaluate the risks and rewards of one’s decisions regarding self and others. This involves understanding the impacts and consequences of one’s actions. College rules will safeguard the interests of the different stakeholders in the College community.

  

The NJC Code of Conduct framework is part of the College’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), which aims to help our students to:

*   Develop self-awareness and management to attain personal discipline and well-being
    
*   Develop social awareness and responsibility for the well-being of others
    
*   Be accountable for their own decisions and actions
    

<u> Restorative Practice in NJC </u>

  

In NJC, the school community works together to ensure that the environment is safe and conducive. One’s action or inaction can affect others and lead to strained relationships. The school adopts a restorative approach to help the community build strong relationships as well as repair those that are broken. There are three questions an individual can ask in response to an incident:

1.  What happened?
    
2.  Who has been affected and in what way?&nbsp;
    
3.  What can be done to make things right?
    

  

The focus on relationship building contributes to a restorative culture where positive relationships between all stakeholders are highly valued.

  

<u>Expectations and Decorum</u>

  

The expectations and decorum of our students are expressed in the following sections.

  

<b>1\. Attendance and Punctuality</b>

  

Good habits and self-discipline are essential for our students’ cognitive and character development. A strong partnership between the College and parents/guardians will allow students to grow to be socially responsible individuals.

  

Therefore, attendance and commitment in school are essential. Students are expected to attend school and all of its programmes throughout the year. This includes curriculum lessons, CCAs, enrichment programmes and remediation sessions, amongst others.

  

<b>1.1 Reporting Times and Late-coming</b>

  

<u>Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays</u>

  

The school gates will close at 7.40 a.m. Students are to be at morning assembly by 7.45 a.m. Students who fail to do so will be <u>deemed as late</u>.

  

<u>Tuesdays</u>

  

Junior High students are to report to lesson venues by 7.40 a.m.
Senior High students with 7.40 a.m. lessons are to report to lesson venues by 7.40 a.m.

<u>Thursdays</u>

  

The school gates will close at 8.40 a.m. Students are to be at morning assembly by 8.45 a.m. Students who fail to do so will be <u>deemed as late</u>.

All students must attend Morning Assembly and Flag-Raising Ceremony, and observe the ceremony with dignity and respect. <b>Students who are Singapore citizens must sing the National Anthem and take the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with the right fist placed over the heart</b>. Non-Singapore citizens should stand still to show respect to the host country during the Flag-Raising and Pledge Taking Ceremony.

  

<b>1.3 Absenteeism</b>

  

Absence from school without a valid reason and leaving school during school hours or before 12 p.m. without permission from the Principal or teachers will be considered an <u>act of truancy</u>.

  

Students who are absent from school should notify their Personal Mentor before assembly.

Students must submit their <b>medical certificate or parent’s letter (maximum of five per semester)</b> the moment they return to school.

  

Only a valid medical certificate issued by a registered medical practitioner will be accepted. A valid COVID- 19 positive test result will also be accepted, subject to prevailing national guidelines.

TCM certificates are acceptable only if the TCM practitioner is registered under the Ministry of Health. However, please note that TCM certificates will not be accepted for tests/examinations. Students who are absent from tests and examinations without valid/approved medical certificates will be given <u><b>zero marks</b></u> for the papers that they have missed.

  

Students who wish to request for leave during the school term (e.g. urgent family matters) are required to submit <b> parent’s letter via email addressed to the Principal (njc@moe.edu.sg), Personal Mentor and Year Head</b> together with relevant supporting documents. All requests are subject to approval by the Principal.

  

<b>1.4 Early excuse during school hours</b>

  

<u>Online Blue Form System</u>

  

Students who are unwell or need to leave school for official functions or medical appointments during school hours will need to seek permission from their Personal Mentor. If the Personal Mentor is unavailable, students can seek permission from their Subject Tutors or Year Head.

  

After obtaining approval for early excuse from the Personal Mentor, students are to approach the General Office Reception counter to sign out their early excuse using the <b>online blue form system</b>. It is considered an act of truancy if a student signs out their early excuse without obtaining approval.

  

Parents/Guardians will be required to pick the child/ward up from the General Office. In the event that the parent/guardian is unable to do so, he/she must consent to the early release via text messages or email to the teacher who approved the early excuse.
