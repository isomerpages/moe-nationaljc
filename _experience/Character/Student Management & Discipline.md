### Student Management &amp; Discipline

**NJC Discipline Framework**

In NJC, it is expected that students exercise responsible decision making and evaluate the risks and rewards of one decision on self and others. This involves understanding the impact and consequences of one’s actions.

The NJC Discipline Framework is part of the College’s Character and Citizenship Education, which aims to help our students to:

1.  Develop self-awareness and management to attain personal discipline and wellbeing;
2.  Develop social-awareness and responsibility for the wellbeing of others; and
3.  Be accountable for the decisions and actions taken by them.

The expectations and decorum of our students are expressed in the following sections.

**1.**&nbsp;**Attendance and Punctuality**

**Resources and effort are put into the school curriculum to ensure that students benefit from them. Therefore, their attendance and commitment in school are essential.**&nbsp;Students are expected to attend school and all of its programmes throughout the year. This includes&nbsp;_curriculum lessons, CCAs, enrichment programmes and consolidation sessions_.

**1.1**&nbsp;**Reporting Times**

Mondays, Tuesday, Wednesdays, Fridays  
All students are to make their way to the assembly area when the first bell rings at 0740hrs. Students are to be in line in their classes by 0745hrs when the National Anthem will be played. Students who fail to do so will be&nbsp;deemed as late.

Thursdays  
On Thursdays, all students will report to their respective homerooms for attendance taking and the singing of the National Anthem at 0840hrs. Students who fail to report to their homerooms by 0850hrs will be&nbsp;deemed as late.

**1.2**&nbsp;**Assembly and Flag Raising Ceremony**

Attendance is mandatory at Assembly and Flag-Raising Ceremony for everyone.&nbsp;**Pupils who&nbsp; are Singapore citizens must sing the National Anthem and take the Pledge. Pupils will take the Pledge with the right fist placed over the heart.**&nbsp;Non-Singaporean citizens should stand still to show respect to the host country during the Flag-Raising and Pledge Taking Ceremony.

**1.3**&nbsp;**Late-coming**

Late-coming without a valid reason is a breach of school discipline. Parents and guardians will be informed via email everyday  if their child or ward is late for school.

**1.4**&nbsp;**Absenteeism**

Absence from school without a valid reason and leaving school during school hours without the permission of the Principal or teachers will be considered an act of truancy.&nbsp;Students who are absent from school will be required to submit their medical certificate or parent’s letter the moment they return from school. All parents will be informed about their child’s absenteeism&nbsp;**by 1000hrs via SMS**.

Only a valid medical certificate issued by a registered medical practitioner in Singapore will be accepted. Note that TCM certificates are not acceptable. Students who are absent from tests and examinations without medical certificates will be given&nbsp;**zero marks**&nbsp;for the papers that they have missed.

Students who wish to request for leave (e.g. urgent family matters) are required to submit a parent’s letter addressed to the Principal together with relevant supporting documents. All requests are subjected to the approval by the Principal.

Blue Slips (Early excuse from school)  
Students who are unwell or need to leave school for official functions,or medical appointments while in school will be issued a Blue Slip by the Personal Mentor or Subject Tutor. Parent/guardian will be required to pick the child/ward up from the General Office. In the event that the parent/guardian is unable to do so, he/she must consent to the early release via SNAAPP or text messages to the Personal Mentor.

**2.**&nbsp;**General Behaviour and Decorum**

**NJC is a community of self-regulated learners, guided by honesty and integrity**.

1.  Students are expected to be courteous and respectful to all members of the school community.
2.  Students have the responsibility to look after the school facilities and its environment. Students must report any case of fault to the Student Services Centre immediately.
3.  Truancy, vandalism, acts of dishonesty, cheating, theft, behaviour that threatens the safety of others (e.g. bullying), and other acts which bring the school name to disrepute will render the offender liable to suspension or expulsion from school.
4.  Food and drinks should only be consumed in the canteen or at the benches beside the café and not be brought to the classrooms or lecture theatres.

**2.1**&nbsp;**Dress Code**

**All students of NJC are school ambassadors who are instrumental in upholding the tradition and reputation of the College at all times.**

Students are expected to be neatly and appropriately attired whenever they are wearing the school uniform.

# DO NOT REMOVE SHAH EDITING

<b>NJC’s Framework</b>

  

In NJC, it is expected that students exercise responsible decision making and evaluate the risks and rewards of one’s decisions regarding self and others. This involves understanding the impacts and consequences of one’s actions. College rules will safeguard the interests of the different stakeholders in the College community.

  

The NJC Code of Conduct framework is part of the College’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), which aims to help our students to:

*   Develop self-awareness and management to attain personal discipline and well-being
    
*   Develop social awareness and responsibility for the well-being of others
    
*   Be accountable for their own decisions and actions
    

<u> Restorative Practice in NJC </u>

  

In NJC, the school community works together to ensure that the environment is safe and conducive. One’s action or inaction can affect others and lead to strained relationships. The school adopts a restorative approach to help the community build strong relationships as well as repair those that are broken. There are three questions an individual can ask in response to an incident:

1.  What happened?
    
2.  Who has been affected and in what way?&nbsp;
    
3.  What can be done to make things right?
    

  

The focus on relationship building contributes to a restorative culture where positive relationships between all stakeholders are highly valued.
