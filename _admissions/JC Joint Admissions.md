<p><strong>What is the JAE?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) is an annual exercise conducted by
the Ministry of Education (MOE). It allows holders of the Singapore-Cambridge
GCE ‘O’ Level results to apply for admission to courses offered in the
Junior Colleges (JC), Centralised Institute (CI), Polytechnics (Poly) and
Institute of Technical Education (ITE). The JAE usually takes place in
January, after students receive their GCE ‘O’ level examinations results.
JAE application is done through the Internet. Students admitted to our
College under this exercise will secure a place in our JC1 cohort.</p>
<p>For more information on JAE, please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/jae" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOE JAE Website</a>.</p>

will be required to bring along your GCE ‘O’ Level results slip (original
hard copy) and Form A (soft copy, or printed).</p>
<p><strong>Important notes:</strong>
</p>
<p>1. All applicants are still required to report to the college that they
are&nbsp;posted to&nbsp;by the Ministry of Education&nbsp;on the morning
of 5&nbsp;February 2025 (Wed) at 7.30 am, pending the outcome of their
appeal application to National Junior College.</p>
<p>2. Please do NOT submit an appeal if you already have a place in another
school under the Direct School Admission (DSA), as it will not be accepted.</p>
<p>3. Please be aware that school admissions are based on objective and transparent
measures of academic merit, i.e. L1R5 aggregate score. Applications are
considered only if the applicant meets the net aggregate score of the lowest-ranked
applicant for the course that he/she is appealing for.&nbsp;<strong>For 2025, the cut-off net aggregate score is 7 for the Science stream and 8 for the Arts stream.</strong>
</p>
<p>Appeals that take place after the JAE will be aligned to these principles,
in order to be fair to all applicants.</p>
