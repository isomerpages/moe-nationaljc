_In view of safe management measures taken due to the Covid-19 situation, please note that JAE appeals may **only** be completed online, based on the instructions stated below._

**What is the JAE?**

The Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) is an annual exercise conducted by the Ministry of Education (MOE). It allows holders of the Singapore-Cambridge GCE ‘O’ Level results to apply for admission to courses offered in the Junior Colleges (JC), Centralised Institute (CI), Polytechnics (Poly) and Institute of Technical Education (ITE). The JAE usually takes place in January, after students receive their GCE ‘O’ level examinations results. JAE application is done through the Internet. Students admitted to our College under this exercise will secure a place in our JC1 cohort.

For more information on JAE, please refer to the [MOE JAE Website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/jae).

**Appeals for Admission to NJC 2-year ‘A’ Level Programme in AY2022**

The JAE appeal period is strictly from **4 February 2022 (Fri), 9am** to **10 February 2022 (Thu), 12 pm and has now closed.**

We thank all students who have expressed interest in joining NJC. We wish all of you the best in your A-Level journey, whether in NJC or other Junior Colleges.
