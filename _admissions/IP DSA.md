**Direct School Admission into 6-year IP Programme for Academic Year 2023 - DSA-Sec Exercise 2022**

The Direct School Admission-Sec (DSA-Sec) Exercise is conducted annually. We invite all interested 2022 Primary 6 students to apply for National Junior College’s 6-year Integrated Programme via the DSA-Sec Exercise.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.

Students who are successfully admitted to National Junior College via DSA-Sec are expected to honour their commitment to the school for the duration of the six-year Integrated Programme, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for throughout Junior High (i.e. Years 1 – 4).

**Talent Areas** 

We invite students with special talents and/or achievements in the following areas to apply:
