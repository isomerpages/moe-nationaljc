<h4><strong>Direct School Admission into 2-year JC Programme for Academic Year 2026 – DSA-JC Exercise 2025</strong></h4>
<p>The Direct School Admission-JC (DSA-JC) is an annual exercise for students
seeking admission directly to a Junior College. We invite all interested
2025 O-Level graduands to apply to National Junior College.</p>
<p>Students who are successful are guaranteed a place, provided that they
meet the eligibility criteria for admission to a JC based on their GCE
O-Level results. Students admitted under DSA-JC are expected to honour
their commitment to the JC. They will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;be
allowed to take part in the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) in 2026. They
will also&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;be allowed to transfer to another
JC after the release of the GCE O-Level results. They are expected to honour
their commitment to the JC and to participate in activities related to
the talent selected in, for the duration of the programme admitted to.
Students who do not fulfil their DSA commitment without valid reason may
be required to transfer out to another school.</p>
<p>For 2025, the DSA-JC Exercise will take place from May to September.</p>
