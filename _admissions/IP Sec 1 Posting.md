The Secondary One Posting Exercise is an annual posting exercise conducted by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to post Primary 6 pupils, who have passed their Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) to a secondary school based on their PSLE results and their school choices. This exercise is usually conducted from late November to December. Students admitted to our College under this exercise will secure a place in our 6-year [Integrated Programme](https://moe-nationaljc-staging.netlify.app/junior-high/integrated-programme)

For more information on the Secondary One Posting Exercise, please refer to this [MOE Website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/s1-posting).
