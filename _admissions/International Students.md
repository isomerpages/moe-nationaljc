**Application to Junior High**

International students who wish to be considered for admission to National Junior College (Junior High) are required to sit for the Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS) or the Supplementary Admissions Exercise for International Students (S-AEIS).

AEIS is for international students seeking admission into Junior High (or Secondary) 1-3 in the following academic year and S-AEIS is for international students seeking admission into Junior High (or Secondary) 1-2 in the same academic year. International students participating in AEIS or S-AEIS would enjoy the convenience of a centralised test on English and Mathematics.

Admission is **not guaranteed**, and is subject to the applicant’s performance in the centralised test. If successful, placement will depend on available vacancies and the applicant’s declared residential area in Singapore.

**Application to Senior High**

All international students who wish to be considered for admission to National Junior College (Senior High) could apply directly from October to December. Admission is **not guaranteed**, and is subject to the international students meeting the college’s admission criteria and availability of vacancies.
