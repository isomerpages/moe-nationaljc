**Returning Singaporeans Admission**

**Application to Junior High**

All RS applicants who wish to be considered for admission to National Junior College (Junior High) are required to participate in the School Placement Exercise for Returning Singaporeans (SPERS) conducted by the Ministry of Education.

Based on the SPERS results, MOE would provide each RS applicant with a list of eligible schools, and if NJC is one of the schools listed, the applicant may indicate NJC as one of the choices on the option form. The eventual posting will be allocated by MOE, depending on the availability of vacancies and number of applications. NJC does not admit RS applicants directly.

**Application to Senior High**

All RS applicants who wish to be considered for admission to National Junior College (Senior High) are required to participate in the School Placement Exercise for Returning Singaporeans (SPERS) jointly conducted by the Ministry of Education and the Principalâ€™s Academy.

Based on the SPERS results, MOE would provide each RS applicant with a list of eligible schools. The RS applicant can approach NJC directly for consideration by first week of January, if NJC is one of the schools in the list. NJC will admit the RS applicant on the condition that he/she qualifies to offer a subject combination that is permissible by NJC.

Interested RS applicants are advised to visit the following websites for details of the exercise.
