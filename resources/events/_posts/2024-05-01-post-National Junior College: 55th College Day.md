<p style="text-align: justify;"> We commemorate our 55th College Day on <b><time datetime="2024-05-11">11th May 2024</time></b> by gathering NJC-ians past and present, family, and friends together to celebrate the achievements of our community.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> This year, we celebrate both College Day and Funtasia, our college carnival, on the same day. In tandem with Funtasia’s garden theme, we embrace this notion of “Growing People, Cultivating the Future” by reflecting on how our college community must be a garden where our students’ curiosity is nurtured, and their skills are honed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In the lead up to the event, our deserving 2023 Junior High and Senior High 1 students received their awards during morning assembly. This inspired a sense of camaraderie as students of all ages cheered and celebrated the achievements of their peers as one college.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> We would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all award winners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Service with Honour!</p>
