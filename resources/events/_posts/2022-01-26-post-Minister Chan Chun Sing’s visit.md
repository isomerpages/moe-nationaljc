#### Minister Chan Chun Sing’s visit

The College was honoured to have Minister Chan Chun Sing experience some of our niche programmes as well as engage in a riveting dialogue with our staff and students.

Minister [Chan Chun Sing](https://www.facebook.com/ChanChunSing.SG/posts/497724771712276) recently visited National Junior College where our students shared with him their passion for astronomy, bee hotels and agricultural techniques.
