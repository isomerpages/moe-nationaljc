**Celebrating Fifty Years as Singapore’s first Junior College**

National Junior College will be celebrating fifty years this coming August, with the staging of an original musical involving current students across both its Secondary and Junior College sections, alumni, and teachers.

The musical, titled “The National Dream” follows the journey of a student of the College, and is set against the backdrop of fifty years of NJC’s history, and its milestone events, including the move from the old campus to the current premises, as well as the introduction of the 6-year Integrated Programme.

With story, script and score written by teachers, and cast and crew comprising current students and alumni, the musical is a celebration of NJC’s development over the years, as the nation’s first Junior College. It also celebrates fifty years of the Junior College, existing as a pre-University intuition integral within Singapore’s educational landscape. Alumni Rani Singam, one of Singapore’s foremost jazz singers, will also be performing during the musical.

The musical will be held on 2 August as the Esplanade Theatre.
