#### STaR Symposium

After nine months of  hard work, we will stage the the annual STaR Symposium on 30 January 2019 to recognise the efforts of research mentors, teachers and students under NJC’s STaR programme.

This year, our guest-of-honour for the event is Mr Ricky Lin, Founder and CEO of Life3 Biotech, Vice-Chairman of SG Health Committee, and District Councillor of Southeast CDC. He will be sharing his insights during the STaR Symposium Awards Ceremony.
