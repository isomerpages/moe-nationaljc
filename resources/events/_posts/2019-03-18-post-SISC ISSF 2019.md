#### SISC-ISSF 2019

As part of our 50th Anniversary Celebrations, we will be hosting the 7th Singapore International Science Challenge (SISC) and the 15th International Student Science Fair (ISSF).

Our Guest of Honour for the Opening Ceremony is Professor Tan Thiam Soon, President of Singapore Institute of Technology. Professor Tan is an alumnus of NJC.

Bringing together the best minds of tomorrow, SISC-ISSF 2019 is designed to enable students to apply multiple lensing and multidisciplinary thinking to improve the human condition. Students gifted in the Sciences from across the globe come together for 5 days to communicate their research in various modes, collaborate in innovating well-designed solutions, and network with one another to establish and sustain partnerships that enable endeavour and enterprise.

The event will be held from 18th to 22nd March 2019 in Singapore. More details [here](https://www.sisc-issf2019.com/).
