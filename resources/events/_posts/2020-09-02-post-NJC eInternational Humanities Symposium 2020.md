#### NJC e-International Humanities Symposium 2020

The COVID-19 situation has presented us with the opportunity to expand the reach of the IHS. The e-symposium will be able to reach a wider audience for students to showcase their research work. It will culminate in a live online conference, which includes a keynote address by Choo Pei Ling, Assistant Professor for Health and Social Sciences at Singapore Institute of Technology. This will also be followed by a live Q&A session, where participants will be able to engage her in dialogue. We will also showcase selected students’ presentations.
