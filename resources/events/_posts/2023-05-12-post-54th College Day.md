We commemorate our 54th College Day on 13 May 2023 with a return to the ceremonial format, gathering NJC-ians past and present, family, and friends together to celebrate the achievements of our community. The theme for this year is “Reconnect ∙ Renew ∙ Reimagine”.

In the lead up to the event, our performing arts CCAs put up rousing performances for Arts Fest 2023. Students took part in activities in their classes where they expressed their well wishes to the College. We also presented [College Day Awards](https://www.facebook.com/nationaljc/posts/pfbid02J9BKnpB2y1jMaMvVJpXe2qpbgevthGi9qMvsnNkaFnnGfH1mArU8numH6ZoPPZyEl) at morning assembly, so that the awardees can celebrate their achievements together with their peers. We congratulate all award winners.

Service with Honour!
