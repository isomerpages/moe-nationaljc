#### 52nd College Day

We celebrate our 52nd College Day from 26th to 30th July 2021 with a series of activities. The theme for this year is “Steadfast, we forge ahead”.

“Steadfast, we forge ahead” speaks to an unwavering determination of NJCians, taking one step at a time to progress forward. 2020 was a tough year for all of us, in many aspects. 2021 has not been any easier.  With resilience and enterprise,  our whole school community has adjusted to changes, and responded imaginatively when challenged by uncertainties that the COVID 19 pandemic has brought about.

Credit goes to all staff and NJcians.
