2023 marks the 16th year of the NJC-CVAHS Twinning Exchange Programme.

Started in 2007, the student exchange programme between National Junior College (NJC) and Chu Van An High School (CVAHS) from Vietnam aims to: 
  
• extend the students’ network of friends internationally and develop positive relationships with students from both countries;  
• allow the students to learn from each other, and cultivate an inquisitive mind and critical thinking skills; and  
• provide opportunities for the students to inspire and motivate others to understand the history, economy, culture and society of Singapore and Vietnam after this programme.
