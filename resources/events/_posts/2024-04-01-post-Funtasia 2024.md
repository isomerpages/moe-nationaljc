<p style="text-align: justify;">
Our College celebrated its 55th anniversary on 11 May with the College Day Awards Ceremony and NJCxEden Funtasia. Held since 2004, Funtasia is National Junior Collegeâ€™s biennial funfair where members of the College community past and present come together to set up an array of booths offering a wide range of games and activities for visitors.
<br><br>

This yearâ€™s Funtasia features the Collegeâ€™s new partnership with Eden School and Eden Centre for Adults under the Autism Association of Singapore. A few stalls were co-hosted by students from Eden and NJC, and funds raised from ticket sales will benefit our partner, Eden Centre for Adults.
<br><br>

We would like to thank Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong for gracing Funtasia as our esteemed alumnus, and for interacting with students from NJC and Eden, as well as members of the public. His presence added excitement to our lively carnival, and we thank him for adding a spark of joy.
<br><br>

We look forward to working more closely with students from Eden School and clients from Eden Centre for Adults in the near future!
