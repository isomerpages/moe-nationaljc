Join us at our campus on 11 May 2024 (Sat), 10am-3pm, for a fun-filled day with members of the NJC and Eden family! All are welcome and all proceeds will go to the Eden Centre for Adults. For more information about Eden Centre for Adults, you may click  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.autismlinks.org.sg">here</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Aside from the exciting stalls set up by our students, look forward to booths selling exclusive NJC merchandise, dunking your favourite teachers, as well as yummy food! More importantly, spend a great day out with your loved ones at our campus, catch up with old friends and teachers, or simply come and bask in the buzz and activity of a carnival! Check out all the booths that we will have for Funtasia via the directory map and view where these booths will be in our Funtasia Walking Tour video below:
