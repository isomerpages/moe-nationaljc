#### International Humanities Symposium 2021

This year’s International Humanities Symposium (IHS) is taking place on Friday, July 16. More than 30 schools both from Singapore and overseas are participating in IHS 2021.

In total, over 70 video presentations were submitted. You can view all the projects here: [https://go.gov.sg/e-ihs2021](https://go.gov.sg/e-ihs2021)

The theme of the symposium:  
_Since the start of 2020, humanity has been grappling with severe challenges: a pandemic, climate change, and social and political upheavals. Against this backdrop of global challenges, the 4th e-International Humanities Symposium 2021: Humanity – Challenges, Adaptation and Innovation, offers students a critical lens to examine the underlying forces, and to showcase their creativity by suggesting new innovative ideas or modifications to existing strategies to address the chosen situation. This will not only heighten the participants’ global awareness, but also nurture them to become invested citizens of tomorrow._

Six NJC teams from Advanced Humanities, Humanities Integrated Programme, H3 Economics and IREP will be  showcasing their work.
