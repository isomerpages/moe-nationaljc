<p>2020 marks the start of our College’s 51st year. This is also a year of
an unprecedented disruption of school and schooling which we were accustomed
to. All stakeholders of our school community have had to adjust to an online
mode of teaching and learning enacted outside of the school building. I
am glad our teachers and students have been able to exercise mental and
behavioural flexibility to adjust quickly to a changed environment.
<br>
</p>
<p>Despite the change thrusted upon us, we must remain steadfast, to provide
our students an education that helps them to seek to know how to think,
not just what to think. We must continue to focus on educating the heart
and the mind, and endeavour to instil in our students the CARE values and
principles that our school has promulgated. We must pride ourselves to
help our students grow and develop into adults with a deep sense of service
to the community.
<br>
</p>
<p>As we complete 50 years of service and embark on our 51st year, we should
take heed that success comes to those who work hard and stays with those
who don’t rest on the achievements of the past. We must continue to strive
and to serve with honour.
<br>
</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank our stakeholders. We are
fortunate to have a supportive and committed School Advisory Committee,
dedicated teachers, concerned and co-operative parents.
<br>
</p>
<p>Service with Honour.</p>

<p>“As a teacher, I hope that ultimately my students are able to&nbsp;persevere
throughout any trials in life and are able to find&nbsp;something that
stirs their passion and gives them happiness. I&nbsp;hope that they will
not be afraid of mistakes but rather have&nbsp;the courage to try once
more. I want them to be able to not&nbsp;only take away subject knowledge
but also values and morals&nbsp;from their journey in NJC.”

their opinions about certain issues related to Science emerge.”

do and discover their passion in life. I would also want them to develop
empathy and learn to uplift others as they grow up to become good citizens
and leaders with sound values. I believe that these traits are important

<p>“The world is no longer what it is and you will be living and leading
in a world, rich in uncertainty where the old ways of doing things no longer
work. You have to really stop just thinking about yourselves but about
each other. There is a difference between pleasure (playing video games,
handphone usage etc) and joy (finding pursuits where you add value to others’
lives). Over time, I hope that you will reduce activities that give you
pleasure.“ <a href="/files/Shanmugadas.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mr Shanmugadas S/O Kumaresadas</a>

<p>“The most satisfying moment for any teacher is when his student, after
years, remembers him and quotes a few small incidents that touched the
student’s life. What looks small to me would have made all the difference
in the student’s life and the feeling is just awesome. No amount of money
can give you the satisfaction that I get watching my students grow.”

<p>“I am motivated when I see the smiles that appear on the students’ face
or the “Eureka” moment in their eyes when they have grasped a difficult
concept or topic. Everyone learns differently and one of the high points
in the teaching journey is to have the opportunity to be creative, think
of various activities to make learning fun and scientific concepts easy
to understand such that students can learn effectively. There is nothing
more rewarding than knowing that you can make an impact on students’ life
with the chance to better each student, both academically and also as a
person.”

<p>“每年我都会问学生“为什么你们要学华文？”这个问题，很多学生的回答是“因为我是华人，我要了解自己的文化，否则别人会看不起我的。“这些回答让我感动，同时也让我明白，作为华文老师除了让学生学华文，更应该让他们明白这个语言的优美、丰富，让他们有机会掌握丰富的文化，让他们的未来因为我懂华文而自豪和骄傲.“

<p>“As they grow up and mature, I hope that all students will find a sense
of purpose in what they choose to do because that will ground them and
give them something to work hard for. As much as having dreams is important,
they should also commit to putting in the hard work necessary for producing
the results that they want to achieve. Above all, they should commit to
being good people who care for others and help to build each other up.”

and shape the future of our nation.”

<p>“更能触动心弦的是一考完试后，学生就立刻发过来的短讯—其中的内容，表达了对老师的感激，甚至觉得自己表现不理想，达不到老师的要求，对不起老师，深感内疚。学生毕业回校探望老师，来到面前告诉你：“老师，我喜欢你的华文课！谢谢你教我华文。”这话会让我睡得很香很甜!&nbsp;能教出懂得感恩的学生还有什么遗憾呢?”
