Join us at our campus on 11 May 2024 (Sat), 10am-3pm, for a fun-filled day with members of the NJC and Eden family! All are welcome and all proceeds will go to the Eden Centre for Adults. For more information about Eden Centre for Adults, you may click [here.](https://www.autismlinks.org.sg/)

Aside from the exciting stalls set up by our students, look forward to booths selling exclusive NJC merchandise, dunking your favourite teachers, as well as yummy food! More importantly, spend a great day out with your loved ones at our campus, catch up with old friends and teachers, or simply come and bask in the buzz and activity of a carnival! More updates and details will be coming soon!
