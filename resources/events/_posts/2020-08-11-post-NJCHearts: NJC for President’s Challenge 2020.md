#### NJCHearts: NJC for President’s Challenge 2020

On 11 August 2020, we launched the NJCHearts fundraising Campaign to support the President Challenge. This campaign will end on 27 Nov 2020.

Enterprising student leaders from various CCAs have worked together to showcase student talent and simultaneously raise funds for the President’s Challenge. We can look forward to dynamic displays from our performing arts groups, including “live” performances.

Specifically, fund raising will be in the form of:  
1) Online charity challenge and appeal for donations;  
2) Collaboration with corporations for pledges of donations when students complete a  
predetermined challenge; and  
3) Posting digital performances to appeal for donations.

Do visit our College’s website, Facebook page or Instagram account to receive updates on the performances and participate in the challenges. Once you have watched them perform, we hope that you will donate generously.
