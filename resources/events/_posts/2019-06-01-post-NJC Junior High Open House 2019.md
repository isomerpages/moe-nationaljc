Hello P6 friends!

Would you like the chance to experience different CCAs in a single year? Would you like to experience school life beyond just textbooks and examinations? Would you like many opportunities to learn from others and become a better person?

NJC gives you a chance to experience all of these and more! We know you will just love the happy problem of choosing only one CCA from so many exciting ones. What about the fun you will have working and playing in all the NJC facilities over your 6 years with us? And won’t you just bask in the warmth of friendship and family feeling among the caring teachers, peers, senior students, as well as uncles and aunties that work in the school grounds and canteen?

Come and join us, to stretch your mind and form lasting friendships in an activity-packed learning environment!

Sign up for our Junior High Open House and be part of our future!
