<p>The last 2 years have been marked by a “Covid crisis” which tested the
resolve and resilience in all of us. As we now begin to emerge from the
other side of this crisis, I want to acknowledge the courage and resilience
that all members of the NJC community have demonstrated.
<br>
</p>
<p>I am proud of my colleagues for their compassion that they have demonstrated
for all NJCians as we navigated the 2 challenging years. My colleagues,
with their resourcefulness, have adapted and have gone the extra mile to
maximise learning opportunities for NJCians.
<br>
</p>
<p>I am proud of NJCians for their readiness to adjust and adapt. NJCians
are respectful, hardworking, and always encouraging. I am confident that
they will continue to go much further and become who each of them hopes
to be.
<br>
</p>
<p>I am proud of the parents of NJCians. They have been supportive and appreciative
of our efforts to help their children learn and grow.
<br>
</p>
<p>I am proud of our School Advisory Committee (SAC) and NJC Alumni for their
encouragement and support. We have been able to fund many programmes and
provide financial assistance for NJCians through their generosity.
<br>
</p>
<p>Together, we are a community and we wield together the strength in our
hearts to ride any crisis. Most importantly, we have grown together during
the most testing of times.
<br>

<p>Service with Honour

<br><strong> Our Guest-of-Honour: Mr. Alvin Yong Yia Chil</strong>

<p>
<br>Mr Alvin Yong Yia Chil is an NJC alumnus from the class of 1984. He is
a social entrepreneur&nbsp;who advocates co-creating social businesses,&nbsp;re-designing
meaningful careers&nbsp;to solve social problems, and to narrow the divide
between the haves and have-nots by adding value to the lives of others.
<br>
<br>In one of Mr Yong’s trips to Thailand in 2009, he launched Tigerland Rice
Farm with the local hill tribes to provide the first-of-its-kind back-to-nature
fun-experiential rice-farming eco-vacations, and supported the hill tribes
to create self-help enterprises. More social projects were rolled out in
subsequent years to reach out to the poor and disadvantaged in India and
Kenya too.
<br>
<br>Two of our students, Edward Thomas Patani and Nadia Azuhar, interviewed
Mr Yong to find out more about his experiences.

<summary>Adding Value to the Lives of Others</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In NJC, our understanding of what Service with Honour means has, in recent
years, been refreshed with the tagline of “adding value to the lives of
others”. This interpretation has given staff and students a clear view
of actions that they can take in order to realise the College motto in
our everyday lives, within the College and in the wider community.
<br>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/col3.png">
</div>
<p>
<br>Staff and students believe that their desire to add value to the lives
of others must start on homeground. This is seen in senior staff mentoring
junior staff since the guiding belief is that “every child wants to and
can learn”, and the continual professional growth of our teachers is key
to the quality of student learning. The mentor’s role, previously seen
as a coach or an imparter of wisdom, has evolved to become one that involves
collaborative learning in a collegial relationship. The mentors in the
NJC fraternity work with mentees to build a learning culture where teachers
are given space and time, and various platforms and opportunities, to have
professional conversations on teaching and learning challenges and best
practices. Undeterred by the challenges to be overcome during the last
year, as face-to-face meetings continued to be replaced by virtual meetings,
lesson observations reduced in frequency, teachers found their own ways
to navigate around these challenges. Thus,&nbsp; we continued to work towards
improving our teaching practices, oftentimes by connecting with fellow
teachers within and across disciplines. In so doing, we continued to add
value to each other’s work, build our teaching community’s capacity to
better serve the learning needs of our students.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/col4.png">
</div>
<p>
<br>Students are also playing their part, demonstrating that their actions
can improve the quality of school experience for others in the College
community. From Student Council to Class Committees, student leaders in
particular, have been exercising their roles in commendable ways. In particular,
Peer Support Leaders, being involved in organising&nbsp; class and school-wide
events like&nbsp;peer bonding activities, Healthy Lifestyle Month and Teachers’
Day Programme,&nbsp;are best positioned to provide some of the needed social
and emotional support to their juniors in lower JH, or to their peers experiencing
difficulties or distress. As the PSLs are identified from within classes,
they are generally aware of classroom situations and their effects on peers.
Not only are they helping selected students with academic challenges, they
are well-placed to alert teachers and school counsellors when circumstances
call for support in the social-emotional areas. This area of service by
students for their peers was especially important and helpful as Singapore
and NJC worked through the Covid-19 experience.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/col5.png">
</div>
<p>
<br>Beyond NJC, students were engaged in&nbsp;service to their community in
various efforts, despite and indeed, because of the challenges of these
Covid-19 times. CCAs did their part where possible, to add to the learning
of others. One example was Greenlink Club who took the opportunity offered
by the virtual Green Symposium, to invite participating schools to start
their own vermicompost projects, offering online support after dispatching
the worm farm kits. One year later, with the easing of Covid restrictions,
at least one school is seeking advice in their next phase to scale up their
vermicomposting project and involve more members of their school community.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/col6.png">
</div>
<p>
<br>Other student segments were also involved in giving back to the society.
One example is the one-day&nbsp;JH2 Intergenerational Learning Programme
in 2021 where different classes engaged senior beneficiaries over zoom
platforms in various workshops – to help them be part of the green movement
as well as bridge the digital divide that was seen to have excluded seniors
from participating in much of social life during the Covid years. These
workshops, designed and prepared by classes over four months, included
sessions teaching seniors to make wallets from recycled materials or fertilizers
from home-based materials, as well as workshops introducing them to Telegram,
the sticker-culture and basic video-making applications. These projects
offered a chance for students to add value to the lives of others by initiating
their entry into virtual communities, and an avenue to grow in empathy
and team work skills themselves, as they learnt to work together.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/col7.png">
</div>
<p>
<br>The NJC community saw an opportunity to fulfill dual aims in the Meal
Support Programme. &nbsp; Conceived in response to the economic devastation
resulting from the pandemic Circuit Breaker, the Programme served to support
both the NJC canteen vendors whose businesses were significantly affected
by a few months of national measures to slow down the virus spread within
schools, as well as many others in the community who had been affected
by job losses. The Meal Support Programme provided an avenue for teachers,
students and parents in the NJC community to work together to contribute
towards a college-wide effort to move resources and benefit multiple communities.
Donations enabled canteen vendors to continue operating their businesses,
providing meals for the members of public in need, with voluntary meal
delivery service support from parents, teachers and students. The coming
together of the different segments of the NJC community at such a time
demonstrated clearly the values of our College.</p>

<p>“To say that teachers add value to students’ lives is only half correct.
I personally feel that students also add value to mine as they share different
perspectives to issues, allow me to experience ups and downs of their unique
life events, and teach me empathy. Through these, they make me a better
person for myself and others.”

<p>“A few years back, a student recommended a book on the Japanese concept
of Ikigai. Ikigai translates to the reason for being.
<br>
</p>
<p>In order to find one’s ikigai, one must know what one loves, what the
world needs, what one can get paid for, and what one is good at. Thus,
in order to add value in another person’s life, I realised that one must
first understand their reason for being. From there, I found my role in
helping them work towards it.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>Like the student who recommended the book to me years back, the students
I have taught, as well as colleagues that I have worked with, across my
15 years in service have added value in my life in one way or another.
I am thankful for all the learning experiences they have given me, and
will continue to do what I can to work towards my reason for being.”

<p>“A teacher’s heart is sensitive, brave, resolute and tender, and at the
core is the question, “How have I made a difference to students’ attitude
and readiness for all that the world has to offer?” My 15 years in service
is not measured only in the value that I hope I have added to students’
lives, but also in the value they have added to mine. I have learned from
them, been inspired and encouraged by them, laughed and cried with them.”

<p><strong>Loke Rui Heng Ryan </strong>
<br>“…give your all to help others and do so without expecting any returns.
That is what it means to be a leader that serves with honour. For whoever
wants to be first has to first be last and the servant of all… This world
will tell you that you will only be successful when you have scored 90
rank points, achieved straight As or won countless competitions. However,
that is not true…Each person’s experience of success will differ, in its
definition or in the speed at which success is achieved. You may never
achieve what you deem as success, but that is perfectly fine. At the end
of the day, you matter and you are enough.”

<br><strong> Chia Shan En </strong>
<br>“I understand adding value to the lives of others as finding ways to enrich
their experience through using your unique strengths to make a contribution.
Value can mean many different things, and can extend far beyond doing community
service or VIA projects…I’d like to encourage all of you to find your passion
and take full advantage of your strengths to make a unique contribution
that will enrich the lives of others both in and out of NJ.”

<br>
<br>“For me, Service with Honour means to always put others before myself,
to try my best to help others in any way I can, and to serve wholeheartedly,
solely with the intention of helping others and not wanting anything in
return. Moreover, when serving others, it is important we honour and not
look down on them, treating the beneficiaries as our friends who simply
need support in a time of need. And lastly, if we open our eyes wide enough,
we will see people who need our help all around us.”

<br><em> The NJC@69ers award, initiated and structured by the first cohort of NJCians, recognises excellence in the arts and humanities, both in core-curricula and co-curricular endeavours.</em> 
<br>
<br><strong> Chia Shang En </strong>
<br>“If you were to ask me what is the value of the Arts, my simple answer
is that the Arts help us to understand humanity. Through the Arts, I came
to better comprehend the position of others, through different lenses and
theories I learned through my studies in the humanities.&nbsp;I know that
the Arts may seem unfamiliar or intimidating, but I promise that if you
look hard enough you’ll be able to find everyday people, and maybe even
yourself, reflected in the texts you read. We need a little more empathy
in this world obsessed with efficiency. If you take up the Arts and take
the road less travelled by, you may find that that has made all the difference.”

<br><strong> Allysa Tan Li Ying </strong>
<br>“I spent the bulk of my research journey in NJ doing Mathematics. You
might be thinking, What? Maths? What can you do with Maths? So many things,
really. I have explored tournaments, the flow of plastic waste in oceans,
and modelling of biological cells; the possibilities are endless. At its
core, doing Maths and Science is not just about doing cool experiments
or coming up with fancy theories, but instead figuring out how we can use
these concepts to add value to the lives of others.”

<br><strong> Project Meraki </strong>
<br>Project Meraki was initiated in March 2021 upon recognition that pandemic
disruption to learning presented an opportunity to reimagine and revitalize
education. After months of project planning and adaptation to the fluid
pandemic situation, Project Meraki, working with the Lakeside Family Services’
The GRIT Project, was launched to engage and instill GRIT values (Grace,
Respect, Integrity, and Tenacity) in primary school children from less
privileged backgrounds, through meaningful activities conducted over a
series of weekly virtual engagements. Project Meraki offered their clients
avenues to experience the joy of learning Science beyond the classroom
through interesting hands-on experiences in a safe space. This project
provided a platform for self-discovery and empowerment for their young
clients to grow to be confident, competent, and caring young people of
good character.

<p><strong>Project Lumi </strong>
<br>Project Lumi aimed to support lower and upper primary level students from
Life Student Care and Yishun Volunteer Care Centre holistically by offering
development opportunities in both their academic work and soft skills through
befriending activities, and by working together with the centre to provide
students with companionship and academic help. With some members also representing
NJ Youth Give Back Programme, the team ran the programme for 8 months from
May to December 2021, with regular weekly sessions for both tutoring and
befriending. This project is now helmed by the pilot project team’s juniors
who are liaising with the volunteer centre and have managed to incorporate
non-virtual sessions too to further improve the service and its impact.
The succession plan ensures the sustainability of the project and continued
service to beneficiaries with the partner organisations.

<br>2020 and 2021 were two unprecedented years, and 480 NJCians sat for the
2021 GCE A-Level Examinations. We are proud of their resilience, their
adaptability, and their grace under trying circumstances.
<br>
</p>
<p>The 2021 cohort achieved a median University Admission Score (UAS) of
83. In addition, 2 in 5 NJCians attained a UAS of 85 or more. More than
1 in 3 NJCians scored at least 3 H2 distinctions. Of the NJCians who offered
4 H2 subjects, more than 1 in 3 obtained 4 H2 distinctions.
<br>
</p>
<p>Beyond their academic achievements, however, NJCians continually learnt
and strived, and contributed to the wider community. We are most proud
of their commitment to Service with Honour, to their CCAs and the College
community, as well as to the rest of society. We wish them the very best,
and look forward to seeing their continued growth and success in the future.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to the class of 2021 and we wish them all the best in their future endeavours!</strong>

<p><strong>CCA Awards</strong>
<br><em> With the pandemic restrictions still in place, national competitions like the Singapore Youth Festival or the National School Games only partially resumed. Some Co-curricular Activity (CCA) groups flourished under the pressure of competing under modified conditions, while other groups found ingenious ways to meaningfully engage and contribute to the college community and beyond despite the limitations faced. Regardless of the form of their contributions, all CCA groups in the 2021 cohort demonstrated empathy, creativity, and commitment to creating a sense of camaraderie and community, ensuring that each CCA was more than the sum of its individual students. We celebrate each CCA members’ achievements and the legacy they leave behind for their juniors.</em>
