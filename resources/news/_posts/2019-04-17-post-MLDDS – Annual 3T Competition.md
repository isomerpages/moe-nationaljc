Twenty seven secondary schools nationwide competed in this competition putting their bilingualism and translation skills into practice in multiple exciting activities.

Thank you all participating schools and we hope your passion for translation continues to grow on top of being aware of the importance of bilingualism and translation skills in various languages in a multi-racial society.
