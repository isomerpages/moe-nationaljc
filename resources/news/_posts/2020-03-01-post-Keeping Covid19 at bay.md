#### Keeping Covid-19 at bay

“Instead of worrying, why not figure out solutions together?” With that in mind,  Vice-Principal and one-time Science teacher Mr Harman Johll rallied his team to create ‘school-made’ hand sanitisers for each class. The team used materials that were already there in school – in the labs and left over from other projects. The lesson for students: Be resourceful, imaginative and, most important, apply what you’ve learnt in Science class! Students were also taught that hand sanitisers are a secondary measure – hand-washing with soap is still the most effective way to protect ourselves.
