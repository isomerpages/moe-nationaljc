#### 50th College Day

We celebrated our Golden Jubilee on 4 May 2019. Our thanks to Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for Environment and Water Resources and alumnus of NJC, for gracing this occasion and for opening our latest agri-tech facility.

Thanks to alumni, parents and partners for their support. We look forward to the next fifty years.
