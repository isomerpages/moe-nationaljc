#### 14th World Dragon Boat Championships

NJC girls represented Singapore in the Junior A team category at the 14th World Dragon boat Racing Championships and emerged **Champions for the 200m event and Runners-up in the 2000m event**. Our girls competed against teams from countries from all over the world.

We are proud that our National Anthem “Majulah Singapura”  was played at the prize giving ceremony. It was an emotional moment for all the dragon boaters who represented Singapore.

Kudos to the team.
