####   NJC 50th Anniversary Commemorative Book

The NJC 50th Anniversary Commemorative Book was launched during the NJC50 Gala Dinner on 17 May 2019. It tells the story of National Junior College (NJC) from 1969 to 2019; a journey from Linden Drive to Hillcrest Road. This book offers a glimpse of the beginnings and the progress of the essential features of junior college life in Singapore, and traces the origins of many of its features and activities. In many ways, the story of NJC is part of the story of Singapore and its education system.

We have very limited copies of this special commemorative book for sale. Interested alumni, please email [_njc@moe.edu.sg_](mailto:njc@moe.edu.sg) for details.
