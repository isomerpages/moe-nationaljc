#### Talk by Mr Jesudason on Foreign Policy

This morning, we invited Ambassador Jesudason (NJC Alumnus) to speak with NJCians on Singapore’s foreign policy. Mr Jesudason highlighted critical points on Singapore’s foreign policy. Our students asked good questions.

As a small nation and city-state, our students need to understand that a sound foreign policy is necessary to ensure our relevance to the world and our survival.
