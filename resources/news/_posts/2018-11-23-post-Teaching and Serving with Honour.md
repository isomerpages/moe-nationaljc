#### Teaching and Serving with Honour

Dr Lim Yi-En is one of the most well-respected teachers in NJC and it is easy to see why. Not only does she use a variety of strategies to engage her students in learning – from using Math formula in her English classes to teach sentence structures and asking students to host talk shows to train their speaking and communication skills – she also works alongside students to tend to the luxuriant gardens in NJC and puts in extra hours to develop her students so that they can blossom into more confident people. Teachers have also benefitted from her guidance in terms of professional development, especially in the areas of curriculum writing and design. Dr Lim shows us all what it means to serve with honour and we are so proud of her for being awarded the President’s Award for Teachers!
