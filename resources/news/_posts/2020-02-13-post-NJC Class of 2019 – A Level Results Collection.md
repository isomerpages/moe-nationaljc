#### NJC Class of 2019 – A-Level Results Collection

Dear Class of 2019 student,

The release of the 2019 GCE A-Level examination results will take place on 21 February 2020 (Friday) at 2.30pm. National Junior College, together with Ministry of Education and Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) have stepped up precautionary measures for the collection of the results to safeguard your health and well-being.

**Instructions for Collection of Examination Results**

3.  _If you are well_, you may collect your result slips and certificates in the school from 2.30pm on 21 February 2020. You may only enter College premises from 1.30pm. Please take your temperature before coming to the school, and you must have already completed your travel declaration in order to come to school (see para 2). Temperature-taking will be conducted again when you arrive in College. You will be collecting results and other documents in a classroom instead of the school hall. If you do not wish to come to school, you can also access your results online.
4.  **F****amily members will not be allowed into the school premises in view of the current situation.** **Only candidates collecting their results will be allowed entry into the school premises.** No parking is allowed within NJC. If you are driven to College, please be advised that traffic in the area may be congested until about 2.00pm.
5.  _If you are unwell_, on Leave of Absence (LOA) or Quarantine Order (QO) as of 21 February 2020, have recently travelled to Mainland China, or affected by travel restrictions into Singapore, please do not come to the school. You can access your results online (see para 7 – 8).
6.  Arrangements will be made for you to receive the hardcopy result slips and certificates if you are not collecting your results in College.

**Viewing of Examination Results Online**

7.  Results can be accessed via the result release system on the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s website from 3.00pm on 21 February 2020.
8.  For Singapore Citizens/Singapore Permanent Residents, you can use your SingPass pin. If you are eligible for SingPass but have not activated it, you will receive a SingPass PIN mailer by 19 February 2020. If you are not eligible for SingPass (e.g., International students), SEAB will provide an email with one-time login details by 19 February 2020.

**Digital Certificate for Application to Local Autonomous Universities**

9.  Starting from this year, all A-Level candidates, who are Singapore Citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents, will receive digital certificates in OpenCerts format.
10.  For international students, you may send your request for a digital certificate via email to SEAB (event is over).
11.  Applications for admissions and/or scholarships to the local Autonomous Universities (AUs) can be done online. All school candidates who apply to the local AUs online do not need to submit a copy of their A-Level certificates. Due to the Covid-2019 situation, the local AUs will also make alternative arrangements for any assessment for admissions if applicants cannot be physically present.
