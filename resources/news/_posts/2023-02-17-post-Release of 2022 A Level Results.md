### Release of 2022 A-Level Results

We congratulate our 485 NJCians who sat for the 2022 GCE A-Level Examinations for their excellent performance. Their results are a testament to their dedication and perseverance.

The 2022 cohort achieved a median University Admission Score (UAS) of 82, with more than 1 in 3 attaining a UAS of 85 or more.

About 1 in 3 students scored at least 3 H2 distinctions and more than 1 in 5 students scored at least 5 distinctions.

In 16 of our H2 subjects, more than 3 in 5 students scored grades A or B.  In addition, about 6 in 7 H3 students scored a distinction or merit in their H3 subject(s).

Beyond their academic achievements, we are most proud of their commitment to _Service with Honour_, to their CCAs, the College and the wider community. We wish them the very best, and look forward to seeing their continued growth and success in the future.
