#### 2022 A-Level Results

We congratulate our 480 NJCians who sat for the 2021 GCE A-Level Examinations. Given the challenging 2 years (2020 to 2021), we are proud of their reilience and achievements under trying circumstances.

Specifically, based on input (meaning the O-Level L1R5 for JAE students and PSLE T-score for IP students), the students have performed within and above expectations for key indicators. The median of 83 A-Level Points (ALP) is similar to last year’s ALP, despite the JAE batch having a slightly weaker L1R5 than their seniors.

In addition, 2 in 5 Njcians attained a UAS of 85 or more. More than 1 in 3 Njcians scored at least 3 H2 distinctions. Of the Njcians who offered 4 H2 subjects, more than 1 in 3 obtained 4 H2 distinctions.

Beyond their academic achievements, we are most proud of their commitment to _Service with Honour_, to their CCAs and the College community, as well as to the rest of society. We wish them the very best, and look forward to seeing their continued growth and success in the future. Njcians must continue to learn and strive and contribute to the wider community.
