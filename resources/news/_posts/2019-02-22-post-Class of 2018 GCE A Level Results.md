Congratulations Class of 2018.

The class of 2018 has done well. About 1 in 2 scored at least 3 H2 distinctions.  About 1 in 2 scored distinctions in H3. More than 35% scored University Admission Points (UAS) of 87.5 and the median is 84.4 UAS.  Congratulations.

Our deepest thanks to our staff, parents, School Advisory Committee and alumni.  Your dedication to NJCians is very much appreciated.

To all NJCians – the next phase of your life begins. Choose where you would wish to study and your tertiary course wisely. For NJCians who might not have performed as well as you had hoped, do not be discouraged. Your A-level results do not determine how well you do in life.

Always live out NJC’s motto “Service with Honour” and live your life to be of service to others.

Thank You.
