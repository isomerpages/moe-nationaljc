With guidance from our training instructor who is a professional photographer to guide our members in prepartion for an annual exhibition, our members not only get to showcase their creative endeavors, but also experience event management where they learn to conceptualise, plan and execute memorable exhibitions. Members also have the opportunity to hold key positions in our Executive Committee to develop core leadership skills such as team-building, strategic planning and problem solving.

By providing VIA platforms such as photography coverage of college events, and conducting training workshops, our members gets to contribute actively to the college and society.
