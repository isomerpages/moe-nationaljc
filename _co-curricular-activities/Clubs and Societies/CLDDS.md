### CLDDS

<img src="/images/CLDDS1.png" style="width:300px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> Our vision is to stimulate students’ interest in the learning of Chinese language and to promote Chinese culture within the NJC community,with the aim to develop students with 21st century skills.. We hope that our efforts will help people understand the beauty of Chinese beyond its practical value as a language and appreciate its beauty from a cultural perspective.

By engaging in these activities, not only do we see a new, creative field of the Chinese culture, we also grow to become NJCians who can confidently present ourselves at debate competitions (狮城杯) and drama performances (SYF and 叶串). We also have editorial and caligrahpy activities,where students can showcase their talent..We strongly believe that these experiences help us emerge as leaders with creativity.
