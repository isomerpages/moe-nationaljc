### Netball (Girls Only)

<img src="/images/netball1.png" style="width:200px;height:320px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> NJC Netball (NJNB) is a team of passionate individuals who are good team players. Each member of our team has the opportunity to develop resilience, good sportsmanship and confidence through training and competitions. For the love of the sport, we aim to push ourselves and the team beyond their limits. With the support of caring teachers and coaches, NJNB will be able to work towards a common goal, developing strong team spirit and camaraderie.

In NJNB, all members of the team are exposed to a variety of playing experiences. This includes participation in various netball carnivals, leagues and friendlies with other schools/clubs. Our members will also learn basic umpiring skills. Valuable opportunities are given to members to organise events and take on leadership roles. Events such as the Intra-College Games, training camps, Open House and CCA Showcase do not just bond the team, but also develop their individual leadership and event-organising skills.

Our netball team not only aims to develop sports players, but also leaders who serve the community with honour, building on the College’s core values with their own student led initiatives. In 2021, we partnered with Kembangan Kidzcare to facilitate educational and recreational activities for underprivileged children online. These experiences are a good platform for the members to serve and create joyful memories for all, especially in the middle of the COVID-19 situation.

“Individually unique, together complete.”
