### Hockey (Boys Only)

<img src="/images/hockey1.png" style="width:350px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> The National Junior College Hockey team aims to develop students as holistic individuals. Discipline, resilience, and sportsmanship are among the many qualities an NJC Hockey player would possess. We seek excellence in developing the individual as a competent Student-Athlete. ‘Take The Shot’, the NJ Hockey motto, inspires us to be courageous and daring in our endeavour both on and off the pitch, and to seize opportunities when they arise.

Our team is built on the core values of ‘trust’ and ‘respect’. We believe that these two qualities are essential to working and excelling together. Here, you will be part of an extended family of teachers and caring peers who will look out for you and enrich you to be the best you can be.

We regularly participate in many interschool and nationwide competitions such as the National Junior League and National School Games. We also have other opportunities outside competitions to enhance our learning experience with programmes such as the Youth Leadership Training Camp, Hockey Camp and Malaysia Exchange Trip. Moreover, we seek to develop camaraderie through self-initiated activities such as hikes and team-runs. By striving to be better players and individuals, we serve to bring glory and pride to NJC.
