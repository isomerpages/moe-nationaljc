### Outdoor Activities Club

<img src="/images/OAC1.png" style="width:300px;height:450px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> Outdoor Activities Club aims to help members develop outdoor skills through activities such as kayaking, hiking and orienteering. Our main focus is orienteering which involves map-reading, navigation and long-distance running. We also take part in the annual National Orienteering Race. Besides that, we also organize activities such as kayaking expedition, high elements course, outdoor cooking and treks through Singapore’s nature reserves. Through these activities, we hope to enable our members to seek adventure in a responsible manner, enjoy the outdoors and see the other side of Singapore.

The Club’s mission is to learn skills which will enable members to handle the outdoors, and to engage in activities that allow the development of resilience and perseverance. We have steely determination and we relentlessly challenge our limits.

It is the goal of the Club to be proficient in applying the skills learnt in challenging and surviving the outdoors, and to be physically fit and mentally resilient in overcoming the obstacles and challenges encountered.

The NJC Outdoor Activities Club (OAC) stands proud as an enthusiastic family which continually seeks new adventures and finds new ways to challenge ourselves outdoors.
