<p>NJC Greenlink is a CCA that focuses on advocating for environmental conservation
and inculcating green conscience in both the College and the community
beyond. Over the years, Greenlink has successfully organised many large-scale
College and community events, influencing students to start their own green
initiatives beyond the NJC community.</p>
<p>Greenlink has three main wings that address different environmental concerns;
the biodiversity wing focused on gardening and wildlife conservation, the
waste management wing focused on vermicomposting, and the waste minimisation
wing focused on recycling. As a platform for leadership development, each
of the wings provide students with opportunities to develop their leadership
competencies, through planning and executing initiatives that align with
their passion and interests. One such initiative under the waste minimization
wing would be the annual Say No! To Disposables campaign, spearheaded by
our members who lead the Green advocates of each JH class to encourage
students to reduce their use of single-use plastics through various school
wide challenges.</p>
<p>Beyond the College, Greenlink spreads the message of environmental conservation
through community initiatives such as our signature vermicomposting programme,
where our members conduct vermicomposting workshops for schools in Singapore
and for the general public to guide them in creating their own vermicomposting
kit, allowing them to reduce food waste and generate natural fertilisers
in their own homes. For our efforts in developing environmental consciousness
within the College and beyond, Greenlink has been awarded the Outstanding
Environmental Outreach Projects Award at the School Green Awards for three
consecutive years from 2017 to 2019. This is the highest recognition given
to schools to recognise their efforts in reaching out to the community
to spread positive environmental impact. Our clubâ€™s work is two-fold: education
and action; and its reach is also two-fold: within NJC and the community
beyond.</p>
