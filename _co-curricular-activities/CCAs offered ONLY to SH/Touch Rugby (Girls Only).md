<p>Touch Rugby welcomes athletes regardless of background and equips the
students that come to us with the values of resilience and joy in learning
the skills on and off the field.</p>
<p>Students will participate in friendlies and competitions available in
the Touch community calendar such as the Inter JC league, and other small
competitions to develop their on-field skills.</p>
<p>Executive committee members rope in members of the team to involve them
in the planning of the annual end of year touch camp to pick up organizational
skills and other soft skills. The team has been spearheading VIA opportunities
for the team as a means of giving back to the community through touch or
related components, depending on the needs of the organization.</p>
