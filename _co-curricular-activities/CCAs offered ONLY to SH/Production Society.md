#### Photography Wing

We educate and provide exposure to various photography techniques through courses, photoshoots, event coverage and long-term projects as opportunities to transfer theoretical understanding to practical skills. We also expose and develop our members to have an artistic vision and appreciation for different fields of photography through our training sessions and learning journeys.

Facilities and equipment within our Sand Box and Dark Room allow members to gain competency through a wide array of studio, film and digital photographic techniques from production to editing. With guidance from our training instructor who is a professional photographer to guide our members in prepartion for an annual exhibition, our members not only get to showcase their creative endeavors, but also experience event management where they learn to conceptualise, plan and execute memorable exhibitions. Members also have the opportunity to hold key positions in our Executive Committee to develop core leadership skills such as team-building, strategic planning and problem solving.

By providing VIA platforms such as photography coverage of college events, and conducting training workshops, our members gets to contribute actively to the college and society. Several of our members have also received accolades from participating in competitions such as the Ngee Ann Konsi Photography Exhibition as part of their portfolio.
