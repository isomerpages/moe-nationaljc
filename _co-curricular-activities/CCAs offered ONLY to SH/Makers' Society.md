As a wing of the Aesthetics Club, NJC Maker Society endeavours to build innovative creative thinking and resourceful problem-solving skills in its members. In addition to Â technical material handling skills, members embark on purposeful projects that aim to liven the environment and serve the community around us.

In a bid to ensure meaningful and enriching growth in this CCA, much of the projects and sessions are designed based on the interest areas of students, guided by specialised CCA instructors and/or teacher-mentor. Sessions predominantly comprise learning through the new and authentic experiences of materials and making, broadly spanning explorations like image-making, prototyping, textile-construction, app development, etc., just to name a few. Members are highly encouraged to pursue and develop their own practices and to push themselves through the participation of various competitions organised by external organisations. Furthermore, members engage with real-world exposure through visits to conventions and exhibitions, and participation in talks by industry professionals, creators, makers, and practitioners.

As a means of serving the community, the NJC Maker Society also goes the extra mile to ensure that the work we do enriches the lives of those around us. We work together with external community partners to bring our skills and services to them. If you are interested in discovering the innovative side of yourself, to inject creativity to your community, or to build your competencies in preparation for a future career in the innovation industry, then the NJC Maker Society is the CCA to be in.
