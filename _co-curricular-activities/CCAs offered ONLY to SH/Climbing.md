<p>The NJC Climbing team has its humble beginnings as a small interest group
who wanted to explore further on Sport Climbing. While we have grown significantly
in size, our members still enjoy climbing activities at the Collegeâ€™s Boulder
Gym which is also the first Boulder Gym in Singapore to have a Tsunami
wall. We hope to provide an environment to develop adventurous individuals
with a sustained lifelong passion for the sport of climbing. We value unity
and our family comprises not just current students and teachers but also
alumni, who even after they graduate, frequently come back to assist in
training activities.</p>
<p>The NJC Climbing team trains at least twice a week, with training schedule
being ramped up to three times a week in preparation for climbing competitions.
To allow students to challenge themselves in the sport of climbing, the
College sends us to take part in various competitions, including the National
Inter-Schools Competitions as well as competitions that are open to the
public. We train in 3 disciplines of the sport including speed climbing,
sport climbing and bouldering. During CCA activities, students of the NJC
Climbing team also learn about safety knowledge as well as belay techniques
and will graduate with certification in Level 1 and Level 2 Sport Climbing.
We also organise various camps, bonding activities as well as overseas
trips to allow students to explore different climbing terrain.</p>
<p>The NJC Climbing team prides itself in its ability to develop individuals
who demonstrate mental resilience to overcome challenges faced and this
has allowed us to achieve various notable accolades and achievements at
the National Inter-Schools Competitions. Our alumni often go on to join
the Varsity climbing teams and have continued to do well in the sport.We
are proud to be home of passionate individuals and sportsmen who excel
in their endeavours and a united family who bond through sharing the passion
for the sport of climbing with others.</p>
