<p>NJC Netball (NJNB) is a team of passionate individuals who are good team
players. Each member of our team has the opportunity to develop resilience,
good sportsmanship and confidence through training and competitions. For
the love of the sport, we aim to push ourselves and the team beyond their
limits. With the support of caring teachers and coaches, NJNB will be able
to work towards a common goal, developing strong team spirit and camaraderie.</p>
<p>In NJNB, all members of the team are exposed to a variety of playing experiences.
This includes participation in various netball carnivals, leagues and friendlies
with other schools/clubs. Our members will also learn basic umpiring skills.
Valuable opportunities are given to members to organise events and take
on leadership roles. Events such as the Intra-College Games, training camps,
Open House and CCA Showcase do not just bond the team, but also develop
their individual leadership and event-organising skills.</p>
<p>Our netball team not only aims to develop sports players, but also leaders
who serve the community with honour, building on the College’s core values
with their own student led initiatives. In 2021, we partnered with Kembangan
Kidzcare to facilitate educational and recreational activities for underprivileged
children online. These experiences are a good platform for the members
to serve and create joyful memories for all, especially in the middle of
the COVID-19 situation.</p>
<p>“Individually unique, together complete.”</p>
