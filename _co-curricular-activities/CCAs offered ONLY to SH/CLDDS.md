<p>Our vision is to stimulate students’ interest in the learning of Chinese
language and to promote Chinese culture within the NJC community,with the
aim to develop students with 21st century skills.. We hope that our efforts
will help people understand the beauty of Chinese beyond its practical
value as a language and appreciate its beauty from a cultural perspective.</p>
<p>By engaging in these activities, not only do we see a new, creative field
of the Chinese culture, we also grow to become NJCians who can confidently
present ourselves at debate competitions (狮城杯) and drama performances (SYF
and 叶串). We also have editorial and caligrahpy activities,where students
can showcase their talent..We strongly believe that these experiences help
us emerge as leaders with creativity.</p>
