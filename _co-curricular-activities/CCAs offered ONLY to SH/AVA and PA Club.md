<p>The NJC Public Address is dedicated to providing technical support to
the College. Over the years, NJPA has been indispensable in the success
of various school events through rendering technical support in terms of
audio visual as well as stage light and sound. Members of this CCA are
equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge required to provide the
best service they can, and will also have the chance to organise their
own event, the annual NJC Rock Night.</p>
<p>The CCA’s Mission is to provide our technical service for the school to
the best of our ability and it’s vision to&nbsp;serve the community with
honor and pride.&nbsp; It’s core values are&nbsp;Confidence, Resilience,
Enterprise.</p>
<p>“First In, Last Out”
