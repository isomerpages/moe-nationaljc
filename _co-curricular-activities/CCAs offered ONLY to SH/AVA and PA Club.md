### AVA and PA Club

<img src="/images/AVAPA1.png" style="width:300px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align="right"> The NJC Public Address is dedicated to providing technical support to the College. Over the years, NJPA has been indispensable in the success of various school events through rendering technical support in terms of audio visual as well as stage light and sound. Members of this CCA are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge required to provide the best service they can, and will also have the chance to organise their own event, the annual NJC Rock Night.

The CCA’s Mission is to provide our technical service for the school to the best of our ability and it’s vision to&nbsp;serve the community with honor and pride.&nbsp; It’s core values are&nbsp;Confidence, Resilience, Enterprise.

“First In, Last Out”
