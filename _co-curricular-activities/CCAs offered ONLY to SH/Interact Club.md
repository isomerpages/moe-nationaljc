### Interact Club

**Inspiring a shared vision**

<img src="/images/interact1.png" style="width:300px;height:280px;margin-left:15px;" align="right"> Interact Club’s&nbsp;mission to build a community of servant leaders is guided by the values of gratitude, compassion, altruism, resilience and enterprise (GRACE). No task is too big or too small. Interactors work together, support one another as we strive to do our very best.

**Our Service**

Proactive in community service, Interactors play a pivotal role in our regular volunteering sessions as we constantly think of new ways to design activities to value-add and engage. From planning and conducting activities to guide the students in Epworth with their academics, Interactors are friendly buddies who motivate them through challenges.  Interactors also bring joy to the residents of NTUC Health nursing Home and the patients at Jurong community hospital with engaging activities. 

**Giving back beyond our Service**

A well established CCA with a Long history in NJC, we actively seek collaborations with others. Together, we hold performances and large scale celebrations to bring cheers to our beneficiaries. Interactors can expect to expand their skill set with attendance at Rotary Club's annual Interact Leadership Training Camp, hands-on experiences brought about by volunteering sessions, meet new friends and connect with like-minded people. If this speaks to you, come join us!

“Touch. Connect. Inspire.”
