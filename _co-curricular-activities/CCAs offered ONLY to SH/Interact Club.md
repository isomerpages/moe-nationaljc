<p>Interact Club’s&nbsp;mission to build a community of servant leaders is
guided by the values of gratitude, compassion, altruism, resilience and
enterprise (GRACE). No task is too big or too small. Interactors work together,
support one another as we strive to do our very best.</p>
<p><strong>Our Service</strong>
</p>
<p>Proactive in community service, Interactors play a pivotal role in our
regular volunteering sessions as we constantly think of new ways to design
activities to value-add and engage. From planning and conducting activities
to guide the students in Epworth with their academics, Interactors are
friendly buddies who motivate them through challenges. Interactors also
bring joy to the residents of NTUC Health nursing Home and the patients
at Jurong community hospital with engaging activities.</p>
<p><strong>Giving back beyond our Service</strong>
</p>
<p>A well established CCA with a Long history in NJC, we actively seek collaborations
with others. Together, we hold performances and large scale celebrations
to bring cheers to our beneficiaries. Interactors can expect to expand
their skill set with attendance at Rotary Club's annual Interact Leadership
Training Camp, hands-on experiences brought about by volunteering sessions,
meet new friends and connect with like-minded people. If this speaks to
you, come join us!</p>
<p>“Touch. Connect. Inspire.”
