<p>Malay Cultural Society (MCS), previously known as MLDDS aims to instill
a deeper understanding of the Malay culture to others while aiming to strengthen
ties between members as well as a platform to actively serve the College
with honour.</p>
<p>MCS organises 3T, an annual nationwide inter-school competition for secondary
schools. It aims to encourage the younger generation to be effectively
bilingual, and highlights the importance of translation in society. All
members will be involved in the planning, consolidating resources and liaising
with external organisations too. Another yearly major event is the Hari
Raya Celebration (HRC). The HRC enables members to reach out to JH and
SH students to come together in promoting the Malay culture particularly
in educating fellow NJCians on the significance and celebrating the festival
with the college community. This allows our members to develop a stronger
sense of appreciation for the Malay culture in addition to honing skills
such as collaboration, leadership and communication. Members also have
the opportunity to visit theatres, attend seminars, dialogue sessions,
and represent school in competitions or other enrichment activities.</p>
