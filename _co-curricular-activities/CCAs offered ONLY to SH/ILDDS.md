<p>NJC Indian Literary Dramatic and Debating Society (ILDDS): Home of Indian
culture, Heart of various talents! We are highly interested in the Indian
culture and aim to conserve and cultivate it through drama and debate as
well as through attending and hosting other literary events. We actively
organize and participate in programmes and enrichment opportunities to
promote and celebrate Indian culture.&nbsp;<em>Velainu vandhuta vellaikaaran da!</em>
</p>
<p>Our passion and interest in the Indian Culture has also motivated us to
take part in many competitions. We are proud to showcase our achievements
over the past few years. We oganise the Inter JC Tamil Debate, the Tamil
Debate competition held biennially that is hosted by NJC, where students
can showcase their brilliant oratorical skills in the form of a dramatic
speech. We also showcase our home-grown talents through drama, dance and
music. This is held together with the Debate competition, Surabhi , an
event not to be missed in the midst of a heated atmosphere. Dance and drama
performances are put up for other JC students to sit back and enjoy. Our
members also went the extra mile and participated in the President’s Challenge.</p>
