<p>The CCA allows students to pursue their interest in playing the game competitively
and to level up their skills under the guidance of the badminton coach
and their teammates.</p>
<p>Two 3-hour court training sessions that incorporate footwork and racquet
skills are conducted every week . In addition, the players conduct their
own physical training on every Thursday morning to build up their stamina.
The CCA also aims to contribute to the larger community through the various
self-initiated VIA projects undertaken by the players.</p>
<p>To align with the College’s mission of grooming leaders who serve with
honour, apportunities are provided for every member to be involved in planning/leading
in at least one CCA-related activity to hone their leadership skills. On
the whole, the Badminton Team stands by it’s mission to groom not only
resilient athletes, but also self-motivated individuals who will pursue
success in all aspects of their lives and inspiring people around them
with respectful and sensitive care.</p>
