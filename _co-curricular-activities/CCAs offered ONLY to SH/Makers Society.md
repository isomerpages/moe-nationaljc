### Makers' Society

At Makersâ€™ Society, we envision to be at the forefront of design, engineering, innovation and enterprise. Integrating knowledge from different disciplines in meaningful and resourceful problem solving, we endeavour to design and build creative and sustainable solutions, which improves the quality of life and environment, add value, and serve the community around us.

CCA sessions and projects undertaken are designed based on the interest areas of students and needs of the College and external communities, guided by specialised CCA instructors and teacher mentors. Sessions predominantly comprise skills development in research, design, prototype making and other technical skills training using modern fabrication methods such as 3D printing and laser cutting.

Members are highly encouraged to pursue and develop their own practices and participate in various competitions organised by external organisations. Through collaborations with other CCAs and external agencies, members will put their skills learnt to design and engineer a sustainable future together. Furthermore, members will engage with real-world exposure through visits to conventions and exhibitions, and participation in talks by industry professionals, creators, makers, and practitioners.

If you are interested in discovering the innovative side of yourself, solving real world issues, injecting creativity to your community, or building your competencies in preparation for a future career in the engineering and innovation industry, then the NJC Maker Society is the CCA to be in.
