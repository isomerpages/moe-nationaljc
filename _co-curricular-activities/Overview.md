### Co-Curriculum Activities Overview

![](/images/cca1.png)

Some of the most crucial learning moments take place outside the classroom. A big part of life at National Junior College involves students in Co-Curricular Activities where fun, imagination and challenges abound. While being conscious of the need for academic excellence, we also strive to develop character and leadership in our students as well. Together as a family, we provide support for personal growth, offering varied platforms and opportunities for every to learn and serve the community around us.

All NJCians in Junior High and Senior High are expected to be actively involved in a CCA. &nbsp;

The following 15 JH CCAs cater developmental programs and various opportunities for their JH CCA members throughout their Junior and Senior High years. JH1 students will choose from these 15 CCAs for their JH years.

#### &nbsp;CCAs offered to BOTH Junior High and Senior High students
