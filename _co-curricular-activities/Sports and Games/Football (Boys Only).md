### Football (Boys Only)

<img src="/images/football1.png" style="width:350px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right">NJ Football aims to build a resilient, tenacious team of NJCians founded on grit and determination, through working and training together. We aim to nurture NJCians into leaders of tomorrow through the beautiful game of football.

The CCA also focuses on building a community of students who will contribute back to the sport, the school and the society. Amidst hectic schedules, NJ Football provides a place for students to bond and create a support system that they can rely on.

NJ football also provides opportunities for students to push themselves to their limits, hone their skills and extend their love and passion for the sport, bringing them onto the pitch through competitions representing the school.

“With consistency and purpose”
