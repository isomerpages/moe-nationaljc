### Touch Rugby (Girls Only)

<img src="/images/rugby1.png" style="width:350px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> Touch Rugby welcomes athletes regardless of background and equips the students that come to us with the values of resilience and joy in learning the skills on and off the field.

Students will participate in friendlies and competitions available in the Touch community calendar such as the Inter JC league, and other small competitions to develop their on-field skills.

Executive committee members rope in members of the team to involve them in the planning of the annual end of year touch camp to pick up organizational skills and other soft skills. The team has been spearheading VIA opportunities for the team as a means of giving back to the community through touch or related components, depending on the needs of the organization.
