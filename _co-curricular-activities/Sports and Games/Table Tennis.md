### Table Tennis

<img src="/images/tabletennis1.png" style="width:350px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> The NJC Table Tennis team aims to inculcate in our members valuable life skills and sound values of resilience and confidence, through the physical and mental challenges of sports. Comprising passionate players with a wide range of abilities, we are committed as a team to bring out the best in one another and nurture individual proficiency regardless of experience and skills.

Besides participating in competitions such as the National Schools Games A division to hone technical skills and gain exposure, we also believe in developing empathy and humility by seeking to create a positive impact on others through Values-In-Action (VIA) opportunities.

The NJC Table Tennis team is where every member supports each other in striving for excellence and where bonds of friendship are forged through sports.
