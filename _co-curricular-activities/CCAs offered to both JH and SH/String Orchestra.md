<p>The National Junior College String Orchestra’s dual mottos, “Passion and
Family” and “Legacy and Vision”, perfectly describe our dedication to nurturing
a passion for music making in a closely bonded community of string lovers.</p>
<p>The String Orchestra, comprising students from JH1 to SH2, has performed
in Vienna and Hong Kong, as well as in some of Singapore’s major arts venues.
We collaborate regularly with the College’s other Performing Arts groups
and have had the privilege of performing for various events both within
College and externally. We have been organising the College’s annual Talentime
since its inception in the mid-1980s, and our highly-anticipated annual
concert Muse-ique”has been consistently performed to a full house at the
Esplanade Recital Studio.</p>
<p>We are committed to building on the accomplishments of the past while
forging ahead in breaking new ground. One of the College’s oldest performing
arts CCAs, we strive to stay relevant by complementing live performances
with digital production. A customised “Enrich, Enhance, Engage” initiative
continues to offer opportunities for our members to appreciate world-class
performances, as well as attend enrichment programmes and masterclasses
to inspire and build capacity.</p>
<p>“Passion and Family
<br>Legacy and Vision”
