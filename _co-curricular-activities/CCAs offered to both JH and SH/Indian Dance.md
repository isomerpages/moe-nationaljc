<p>Indian Dance is a community that prides itself in injecting passion and
energy into our performances. We aim to expose students to the beautiful
art of dance, which serves to bring out the best in each member. We take
pride in our performances and have consistently be successful. We are a
vibrant CCA with dancers from various ethnic groups. Through this, we have
formed a multicultural CCA despite our namesake.</p>
<p>We train in various dance forms including classical and folk, thus training
ourselves to be versatile in the field of dance. We aim to develop each
member to their fullest potential through our dance practices and enrichment
activities. We have incorporated the various aspects into our CCA to enrich
each dancer in a multitude of ways namely wth enrichment programmes, Community
Involvement Pogrammes as well as performing in major events within and
outside of school.</p>
<p>We firmly believe what is most important is the camaraderie and team spirit
of Indian Dance, the driving force for our sustained excellence. With the
strong pillar of support from our fellow dancers and teachers, we will
continue to work hard and strive onward.</p>
