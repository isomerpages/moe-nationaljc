<p>NJC Western Dance is a contemporary dance group which is founded upon
our passion for dance. We aim to become a highly regarded dance group and
we work towards improving and pushing ourselves beyond our limits. As dancers
working in a closely-knitted team, the team is always at the forefront
of our minds. Apart from having vigorous training sessions which train
us to push beyond our comfort zones and expose us to new ways of expressing
ourselves, we have the opportunity to play a part in performing in intra-College
and external events such as the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Arts
Presentation for Dance (International Dance Category). These performance
opportunities have definitely helped us to gain more stage experiences
and has allowed us to achieve many accolades. These accolades are a tangible
display of our hard work, resilience and dedication of the dancers in the
team.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our dancers have opportunities to hone their leadership skills
by taking on leadership positions at both the JH and SH levels. These include
being part of the Executive Committee (EXCO) and various sub-committees.
Our dancers also organise and participate in Values-In-Action (VIA) activities
with the goal of serving the community through dance, and to contribute
to arts appreciation in Singapore.</p>
<p>Through our shared experiences, we build strong bonds, support and encourage
each other to strive for improvement. We fight through every ordeal as
a team, and emerge from it even stronger. We hope that our performance
reflects our emotions, and “to watch us dance, is to hear our hearts speak”.
