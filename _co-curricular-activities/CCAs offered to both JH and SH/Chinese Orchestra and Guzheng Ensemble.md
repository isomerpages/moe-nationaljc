<p>National Junior Chinese Orchestra and Guzheng Ensemble (NJCOGZ) encompasses
students who have love for the arts and strive for musical excellence.
Our members’ passion for music is nurtured in a vibrant environment where
they learn different skills while cultivating the College values of civility,
altruism, resilience and enterprise.</p>
<p>NJCOGZ participates in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) where
we showcase musicality and hardworkship, achieving admirable results over
the years. We also engage in College activities like Chinese New Year celebrations,
Open House and CCA showcases. Our members hone their skills and build confidence,
while encouraging audiences to appreciate the beauty of Chinese orchestral
music through these events.</p>
<p>Taking pride in inculcating charactership and values, we participate and
organise community outreach events, often highlighting our musical skills,
such as the annual Music for Your Years event where we interact with the
elderly of the community, where we volunteer and perform. These student-initiated
events, with mentorship from our teachers, gives us a chance to grow into
leaders and serve others.</p>
