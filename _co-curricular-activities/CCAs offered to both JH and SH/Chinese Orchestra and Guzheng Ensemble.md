### Chinese Orchestra and Guzheng Ensemble

<img src="/images/coge1.png" style="width:350px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align="right"> National Junior Chinese Orchestra and Guzheng Ensemble (NJCOGZ) encompasses students who have love for the arts and strive for musical excellence. Our members’ passion for music is nurtured in a vibrant environment where they learn different skills while cultivating the College values of civility, altruism, resilience and enterprise.

NJCOGZ participates in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) where we showcase musicality and hardworkship, achieving admirable results over the years. We also engage in College activities like Chinese New Year celebrations, Open House and CCA showcases. Our members hone their skills and build confidence, while encouraging audiences to appreciate the beauty of Chinese orchestral music through these events.

Taking pride in inculcating charactership and values, we participate and organise community outreach events, often highlighting our musical skills, such as the annual Music for Your Years event where we interact with the elderly of the community, where we volunteer and perform. These student-initiated events, with mentorship from our teachers, gives us a chance to grow into leaders and serve others.
