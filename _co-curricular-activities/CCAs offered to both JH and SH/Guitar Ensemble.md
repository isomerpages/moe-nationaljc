<p>In the NJC’s Guitar Ensemble, students can expect to learn basic to intermediate
classical guitar playing skills without the need for prior knowledge or
experience. Subsequently, they can choose to take part as an ensemble in
the Trinity College of London Guitar Ensemble Exam at 3 different levels;
beginner, intermediate and advanced.</p>
<p>Through the course of the CCA, they can expect to benefit from the tutelege
of master conductors from overseas, be given opportunities to perform in
yearly concerts both internally and externally and be given chances to
go on Overseas Learning Journeys. We believe that through the pursuit of
musical excellence as an ensemble, we will be able to develop our students
holistically and equip them with skills that will serve them well in the
future. Most importantly we hope that they will emerge from the programme
as young adults who are grounded by a strong set of moral values and be
able to contribute positively to the society.</p>
<p>The CCA believes in&nbsp;cultivating the passion for music through the
love of guitar, maximizing the potential in each aspiring musician.</p>
<p>“If music is life, guitar is love.”</p>
