### Guitar Ensemble

<img src="/images/guitar1.png" style="width:350px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> In the NJC’s Guitar Ensemble, students can expect to learn basic to intermediate classical guitar playing skills without the need for prior knowledge or experience. Subsequently, they can choose to take part as an ensemble in the Trinity College of London Guitar Ensemble Exam at 3 different levels; beginner, intermediate and advanced.

Through the course of the CCA, they can expect to benefit from the tutelege of master conductors from overseas, be given opportunities to perform in yearly concerts both internally and externally and be given chances to go on Overseas Learning Journeys. We believe that through the pursuit of musical excellence as an ensemble, we will be able to develop our students holistically and equip them with skills that will serve them well in the future. Most importantly we hope that they will emerge from the programme as young adults who are grounded by a strong set of moral values and be able to contribute positively to the society.

The CCA believes in cultivating the passion for music through the love of guitar, maximizing the potential in each aspiring musician.

“If music is life, guitar is love.”
