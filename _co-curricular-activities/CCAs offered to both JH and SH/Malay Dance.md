<p>The National Junior College Malay Dance (NJCMD) epitomizes uniqueness
and cultural integration. Our dance troupe consists of students from multi-ethnic
backgrounds: Chinese, Indian, Javanese, Burmese, Korean, Indonesian and
Malay students. Every culture has its own beauty and we are more beautiful
together in our diversity. This multi-ethnic composition adds to the vibrancy
of NJCMD and encourages mutual growth through dance with fellow dance mates.</p>
<p>Every dancer strives to execute their movements to the best of their ability
so that we can engage, amaze and inspire. Without any verbal communication,
dance has the ability to transcend language boundaries and bring different
communities together. We believe in stringing our individual stories, dancing
in unison, synchronizing even our breaths and growing as a family. Being
different doesn’t mean we can’t be one. We participate in the NJC dance
concert, Aristal, which is a platform where our dancers are able to pursue
their passion and talent. We also celebrate youth vitality through the
showcasing of diverse and high standards of artistic talents and creativity.</p>
<p>Malay dance is not only about the series of routine and the monotonous
memory work of dance steps but built on character, emotions, teamwork and
discipline. Besides cultivating appreciation of the Arts in all students,
we aim to develop leaders based on the principles of servant leadership.
Student leaders are actively involved in management of the CCA which includes
budget planning and creating opportunities for every dance member to develop
their leadership skills and experience social emotional learning through
the arts. Besides striving for personal excellence as a dancer, we value
opportunities which allow dancers to tap on their own unique strengths
in contributing back to society through our VIA engagements.</p>
<p>“Being different doesn’t mean we can’t be one.”
