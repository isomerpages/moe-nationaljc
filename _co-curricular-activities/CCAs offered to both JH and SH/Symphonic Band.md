### Symphonic Band

<img src="/images/sympband1.png" style="width:350px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> Formed in 1969, the same year National Junior College was established, NJCSB has been integral to the culture and rich heritage of our College. The Band first functioned as a brass band under the tutelage of its conductor, Associate Professor Ho Hwee Long, and has since won accolades both within and beyond Singapore. In 2009, with the advent of the Integrated Programme, the band has welcomed a new group of members, forming the Junior High wing. The Junior High band, currently under the baton of Mr Seow Yibin has also made commendable achievements in their early years of establishment.

The Band has been an integral part of college life, performing at morning assemblies and for various college functions. It has also participated in many local and overseas programmes to achieve higher standards of musicality, including the Singapore International Band Festival and the Wind Band Association of Singapore’s (WBAS) annual Youth Arts Festival. Each year, the Band also performs at Etude, its flagship series of concerts which showcases the talent, energy and passion for music of young musicians in NJCSB. In 2018, the combined efforts of the Junior and Senior High wings won the band a Silver in the Hong Kong Winter Band Festival, while the Junior High section went on to achieve a Distinction award as part of the Singapore Youth Festival in 2019.

The band’s motto, “Triumph in Harmony”, encompasses more than our commitment to performance standards – it aptly captures our aim to develop team spirit in servant leaders who inspire with honour.
