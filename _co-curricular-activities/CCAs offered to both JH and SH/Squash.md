### Squash

<img src="/images/squash1.png" style="width:350px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align="right"> NJC’s Squash has both boys’ and girls’ teams competing at the A Division (SH1 and SH2), B Division (JH3 and JH4) and C Division (JH1 and JH2).

Training sessions are twice a week (weekdays only) and the sessions do not extend beyond 6pm except for the A Division (SH) teams where training might end at 7pm during the competition period (from 1 February to 30 April). Our training programme focuses heavily on match-play and all players are required to take part in up to four external competitions every year on top of the National Schools competitions. We also take in students through Direct-School-Admission (Squash) at the Sec 1 and JC 1 level. Primary 6 girls interested in applying DSA through Squash need not have prior experience in sports but they will be assessed on their ball sense (ability to hit the ball) during a trial.

The CCA seeks to instil in students, a life-long passion for squash, build up their confidence and the tenacity to overcome obstacles, build life-long friendships with their teammates and appreciate the positive values of team work, sportsmanship, courage and resilience.&nbsp; The CCA envisions to develop fit, healthy, resilient and confident individuals who can excel in both studies and squash.
