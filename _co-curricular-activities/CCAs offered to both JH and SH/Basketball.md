### Basketball

<img src="/images/basketball1.png" style="width:350px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align="right"> A ‘Dare to Dream’ approach to ignite, inspire, develop character and build the confidence of every NJC basketball player so that he/she can succeed in life. Education is the key to unlocking opportunities and developing productive student athletes. Every student athlete will be guided to be a responsible and values-based leader.

Development Programmes and Enrichment Opportunities:

*   CCA Overseas Training Tour
*   Team Bonding Camps and Activities
*   Planning and Organizing Competitions
*   Values In Action (VIA)

The CCA’s Mission is to develop passionate leaders, ready to lead selflessly, purposefully and compassionately both on and off the court.&nbsp; They believe in two philosophies: Effort and Commitment. To have all members see beyond the game. It is not about winning or losing. It is not about the skills or drills. It is not about just basketball. It is about being a person. Being human. Basketball is just our vehicle to get there.

“Passion, Resilience, Trust.”
