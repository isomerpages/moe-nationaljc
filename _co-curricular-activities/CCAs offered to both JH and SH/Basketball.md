<p>The CCA’s Mission is to develop passionate leaders, ready to lead selflessly,
purposefully and compassionately both on and off the court.&nbsp; They
believe in two philosophies: Effort and Commitment. To have all members
see beyond the game. It is not about winning or losing. It is not about
the skills or drills. It is not about just basketball. It is about being
a person. Being human. Basketball is just our vehicle to get there.</p>
<p>“Passion, Resilience, Trust.”
