### Shooting Club

<img src="/images/shooting1.png" style="width:350px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> The NJC Shooting club aims to develop all members into leaders passionate about what they do, with strong character values of integrity. Our shooters are sportsmen who constantly challenge themselves, as they persevere through the various challenges that come their way. We are also engaged in various developmental activities such as planning and organising CCA VIA and camps.

Their mission is to develop shooters into leaders with passion, marksmen with integrity and sportsmen with perseverance in the journey of self discovery and they envision to develop shooters with, or without, experience to reach international standards.

“If you do what you’ve always done, you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.”
