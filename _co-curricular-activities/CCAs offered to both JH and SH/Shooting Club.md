<p>The NJC Shooting club aims to develop all members into leaders passionate
about what they do, with strong character values of integrity. Our shooters
are sportsmen who constantly challenge themselves, as they persevere through
the various challenges that come their way. We are also engaged in various
developmental activities such as planning and organising CCA VIA and camps.</p>
<p>Their mission is to develop shooters into leaders with passion, marksmen
with integrity and sportsmen with perseverance in the journey of self discovery
and they envision to develop shooters with, or without, experience to reach
international standards.</p>
<p>“If you do what you’ve always done, you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.”</p>
