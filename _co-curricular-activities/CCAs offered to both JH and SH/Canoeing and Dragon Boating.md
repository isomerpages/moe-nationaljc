<p>Reflecting our value of FIGHTERS, Canoeing aims to mould our students
into esteemed fighters who are disciplined and give their best effort,
off and on water.</p>
<p>Our canoeing season runs from August to April, where take part in various
competitions: Singapore Canoe Marathon, Singapore Junior Canoe Sprint Championships,
National Canoe Sprint Championships and the National Schools Canoeing Championships,
offering multi-platforms for our students to demonstrate their skills and
sportsmanship. Our Dragon Boat season runs from May to July, where the
team will train for the National Schools Dragon Boat Championships. In
June, we have our bonding camp, where the whole team gets together to build
camaraderie. December sees the training camp, where the team will reaffirm
their training beliefs and set targets for the upcoming national schools
competition. All competition logistics and camps are planned by students,
which offer them various opportunities on top of the exco positions for
them to explore and develop their potential to the fullest.</p>
<p>We also believe strongly in giving back to the community, where our students
take part in various VIA projects. Our A division has been working with
MINDS (Eunos) since 2015 where we support them in their Christmas celebrations
and also sports related activities. Our B and C division have been working
with Sarah Homes from Bukit Merah, befriending the seniors citizens of
the estate.</p>
