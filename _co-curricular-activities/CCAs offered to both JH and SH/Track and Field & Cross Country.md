<p>The Track and Field / Cross-Country CCA functions as one big family despite
having 6 very distinctive groups of students who specialise in skills of
sprinting, jumping, throwing, long distance running, race walking and hurdling.
We welcome students from both junior and senior high levels, regardless
of their prior experience.</p>
<p>The Track and Field team has made its mark in various competitions and
events, and stands by a strong training programme for the team. Leaders
are nominated to attend the Collegeâ€™s Youth Leadership Training Camp.</p>
<p>We provide ample opportunities for students to work with track teams from
other schools, the National Sporting Association (Singapore Athletics Association),
meet with International Track Athletes and Local National Athletes, enter
various competitions for all disciplines and all ages (not limited to just
school team members). Also, our members get to participate in Values In
Action programmes like working with disadvantaged children and raising
awareness for organisations as well as experience leadership positions
under the mentorship of teachers &amp; coaches.</p>
