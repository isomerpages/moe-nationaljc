<p>NJCâ€™s Choir aims to maintain the fine tradition of choral excellence so
as to bring honour to the College. We provide students who are passionate
about choral singing with opportunities to develop their knowledge and
proficiency in the performance of choral pieces through progressive and
rigourous training programmes with expert instructors at the Junior High
and Senior High levels.</p>
<p>There are opportunities within and outside the College, at the national
or international level, for students to display their talents and skills.
We also provide opportunities for leadership and character building through
student-directed initiatives that are meaningful and engaging. We build
strong relations between the Choir and stakeholders (teachers, conductors,
students, alumni and the community) through interaction and collaborative
efforts.</p>
<p>The National Junior College Choir of Singapore (established 1969) aims
to continue to build on its tradition of choral excellence so as to enable
our members to attain world-class standards. This will be done in particular
through nurturing their deep passion for choral singing and cultivating
in them a strong sense of character and mental strength. All this will
lead ultimately to bringing honour to the College and Country.</p>
