By the end of Junior High, all students would have learned a variety of sports and games through the physical health and fitness modules and the outdoor education. These sports and games include Football, Badminton, Basketball, Softball, Netball, Volleyball, Tchoukball, Ultimate Frisbee and Floorball. The categories of skills taught include net barrier, invasion and striking and fielding.

Knowledge on physical health and fitness is essential for the physical well-being of our students.  At every level, students will be equipped with such knowledge through physical fitness training as well as theory lessons.  Students will also learn and experience a variety of water and land outdoor education and adventure modules such as cycling, dragon boating, kayaking, skating, etc ….  In order to provide students with confidence in water activities, ad-hoc basic swim safer lessons will be offered.
