<img src="/images/physics1.png" style="width:350px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> The study of physics aims for us to better understand and appreciate the natural world around us. Journeying through space and time, we will adopt a critical scientific lens in exploring and questioning phenomena that early philosophers and physicists faced. From debunking Galilean mechanics to exploring the unknown world of electrodynamics, a variety of experiential learning activities will be used to help students explore and question our amazing world with a Physics lens.
