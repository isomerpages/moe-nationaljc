#### LA Department Philosophy, Mission, Vision

##### **Philosophy**
The LA Dept believes that language is the vehicle of thought and it is very important for allstudents to have a high proficiency in the English language. Language is not just a tool forthinking, learning and sharing of learning, it is also a tool for socializing, and a means forarticulating their opinions, dreams and aspirations. For many, it is a means to express theiridentity and relationship with the world around them. Language acquisition sets an individualon the paths of all other academic endeavours and of self\-discovery. In an increasinglyglobalized world where rapid development in information technology is part of our lives, thereis an even greater need for linguistic and communicative competence. The teaching of literacyand linguistic skills in English needs to include multiliteracies so that students can be literatein responding to and using multiple modes of communication, with audience, purpose andcontext in mind.

##### **Mission**
The Language Arts Programme aims to develop studentsâ€™ ability tocommunicate effectivelyby developing their receptive skills (listening, reading and viewing), productive skills (speaking,writing and representing) and thinking skills in a progressive way and helping them recognizethat text and language choices are based on the factors of audience, purpose and context.Students should become empathetic communicators, discerning readers and critical thinkers.

##### **Vision**
To empower students to think critically and express themselves confidently, accurately and fluently.
