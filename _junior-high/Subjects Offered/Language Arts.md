<h4><strong>LA Department Philosophy, Mission, Vision</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>The LA Dept believes that language is the vehicle of thought. Language
is not just a tool for thinking, learning and sharing of learning, it is
also a means for socializing, articulating our opinions and expression
our identities and relationship with the world around us. In an increasingly
globalized world where rapid development in information technology is part
of our lives, there is an even greater need for linguistic and communicative
competence. The teaching of literacy and linguistic skills in English needs
to include multiliteracies so that students can respond to and effectively
use multiple modes of communication, with audience, purpose and context
in mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>The Language Arts programme aims to develop students’ ability to communicate
effectively by developing their receptive skills (listening, reading and
viewing), productive skills (speaking, writing and representing) and thinking
skills in a progressive way. Students will recognize that text and language
choices are based on audience, purpose and context. Through our programme,
students become empathetic communicators, discerning readers and critical
thinkers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>To empower students to think critically, express themselves confidently,
accurately and fluently and communicate and collaborate well with others.</p>

<h4><strong>LA Talent Development Opportunities</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students who have displayed aptitude in our discipline may be identified
for talent development. Here is an overview of our Talent Development Opportunities:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Writer’s Circle</strong></h4>
<p>A mentorship programme run by NJC for JH students, focused on creative
writing.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participants will meet fellow
members in monthly or bi-monthly workshops and engage in creative writing
activities and feedback/critique sessions.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will participate in and
submit polished drafts/portfolios to competitions, The Creative Arts Programme,
and open calls.</p>
<p>Students get the opportunity to share/feature &nbsp;their writing in NJC,
whether in an online zine or in a performance event, and contribute to
the reading and writing culture in NJC and beyond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Writing Competitions</strong></h4>
<p>All students are invited to write creatively and analytically and many
platforms are available within the college as well as externally for students
to share and showcase their work. Some writing competitions include the
Royal Commonwealth Essay, Torrance Creative Writing, Foyle Young Poets,
A*STAR Science Chronicles, and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>National Schools Literature Festival (NSLF)</strong></h4>
<h4>Held biannually, the National Schools Literature Festival (NSLF) is a literary festival for students in Singapore and has provided a powerful platform to develop students’ passion and love for literature. Students get to take part in activities such as choral speaking, flash fiction writing, unseen debate and book trailer!</h4>
<h4><strong>Plain English Speaking Competition (PESA)</strong></h4>
<p>Students who are proficient in speaking and are keen to hone their public
speaking skills may be selected to take part in PESA. The objectives of
PESA are:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To promote public speaking as an important social and academic skill</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide an avenue for students to sharpen their speaking skills and
to build confidence in public presentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide opportunity to learn by observing other proficient speakers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop a personal voice ("Believe in what you are saying and enjoy
speaking. Let your own voice be heard.")</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Creative Arts Programme (CAP)</strong></h4>
<p>Secondary 2-3 students who have submitted good portfolios and are selected
will attend</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>writing workshops which give young writers the chance to work with other
young writers and learn from established writers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enrichment sessions which expose participants to interesting and relevant
issues on writing and the arts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>performance workshops which offer participants the opportunity to learn
an art form under the charge of an arts practitioner and come up with a
performance which may be chosen for showcase</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Literature Seminar (organised by MOE GEB)</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Literature Seminar is an annual event held in August. It comprises literary
enrichment workshops by prominent writers or academics of Literature in
Singapore, as well as presentations on literary research projects by secondary
school students. It provides participants with a better understanding of
the breadth of literary studies. This is typically offered to upper JH
students offering Advanced Language Arts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Humanities and Social Sciences Research Programme (HSSRP) (organised by MOE GEB)</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>HSSRP offers Secondary 3 and 4 students in Integrated Programme (IP) schools
a valuable opportunity to engage in humanities and social sciences research
under the guidance of academic researchers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Moot Parliament Programme (MPP) (organised by MOE GEB)</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>MPP offers students insights into how public policies and legislative
bills are passed in Singapore. Participants will research community and
national issues and learn about Bill crafting under the guidance of expert-mentors
from the legal profession.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Thinking</strong></h4>
<p>Critical thinking is incorporated and taught throughout the 4 years in
Language Arts lessons. Students are introduced to Richard Paul’s Wheel
of Reason to help them to analyse, understand and evaluate the texts and
issues that they encounter.</p>
<p>From JH1, students are made aware of the processes involved in critical
thinking when they are exposed to inference and assumptions, two of the
elements of reasoning in ‘The Elements of Thought’. As they move up the
levels, they will be exposed to more/all elements of reasoning and be given
ample opportunities to apply their critical thinking and reasoning in class,
through their work and under assessment conditions.</p>
<p>For upper JH students who enjoy critical thinking, they may be offered
an elective called Man and Ideas (MI). Using inquiry as the approach to
learning, MI engages students in questioning, challenging assumptions and
known knowledge, exploring what they do not yet know, and in so doing,
make them better thinkers and decision-makers.</p>
