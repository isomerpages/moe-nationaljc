### History




*“History is who we are and why we are the way we are.” - David McCullough, American historian*

  

**Aims and Objectives**

  

History seeks to empower students to become global citizens through an appreciation of how past events have shaped the world we live in today. Through an inquiry-based learning approach, students encounter and empathise with different perspectives and interpretations of the past, and learn to navigate their way in an uncertain and complex world. Through these excounters, our students develop a sense of curiosity and wonder about the world in which they live, and are encouraged to practice informed, discriminating and active citizenship essential to building a society and nation. 

  
**Curriculum**

  

All students will read History in JH1 and JH2. They will decide at the end of JH2 if they want to continue reading History at Upper JH.

  

The Lower Secondary History syllabuses seek to imbue in our students a sense of national identity and appreciation by helping them understand how the Singapore they live in today was shaped by forces of old. Through active learning experiences such as seminars, field trips, and Historical Investigation projects, History students encounter how historical circumstances and actors interacted to set us on the path we currently tread, as well as Singapore’s role in the world today. 

  

The Upper Secondary History syllabuses focuses on developing students’ understanding of how the present global system came into being, as well as the inter-connectedness of nation-states and peoples. Through seminar activities and performance tasks, students will examine how the end of the First World War sowed the seeds for the Second World War, as well as how the end of the Second World War laid the foundations for the Cold War, the repercussions of which still reverberate in the world today. We will also examine developments in our backyard: the colonisation of Southeast Asia, which resulted in the rise of nationalist forces in the postwar years that led to independence in after WW2. 

  

**Stretch Opportunities**

  

Students who demonstrate great passion and potential in the subject have the opportunity to represent the college in various history competitions, and may be selected for the MOE History Talent Development Programme.
