### Enhanced Boarding Programme

<img src="/images/ebp1.png" style="width:80%">

The Enhanced Boarding Programme (EBP) implements the activities aligned to Strategic Thrusts (STs) 1, 2 and 3. The outcomes of EBP are NJCians who possess a deep sense of responsibility to the community and nation, excellent character, sound leadership and a passion for the pursuit of knowledge and interest.  To realise these outcomes, a purposefully planned and delivered curriculum has the following focus:

**Sustained development of self-identity and building of character**

**Nurturing of community awareness and rootedness**

Through the diverse communal experiences, students put into practice what they learn about respect for diversity, communication, self-management, resilience and responsible decision-making in an authentic environment. With further guidance by the teachers, students will be sensitised to the thinking and principles of leadership challenges.

**Rigorous leadership development**

The boarding environment contributes to the quality of students’ leadership experience where they come into contact with leadership theory, strategic thinking and philosophy, with inspiring role models. They have a chance to conceptualise, plan, organise, run and participate in special activities.

**Capacity building through non-examinable components**
