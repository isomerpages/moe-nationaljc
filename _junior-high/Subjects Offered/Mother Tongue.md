<h3>Mother Tongue</h3>
<p>The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Department follows the MOE “O” Level
syllabus and offers both Higher Mother Tongue Language (HMTL) and G3 Chinese
Language. In line with our Integrated Programme, we are committed to creating
a vibrant and engaging learning environment where students develop a genuine
love for their mother tongue.</p>
<p>Our curriculum emphasizes the development of five core language skills:
speaking, writing, listening, reading, and thinking by integrating MOE’s
emerging 21st&nbsp;century competencies. These are nurtured through a wide
range of enriching experiences such as inquiry based learning projects,
learning journeys, workshops, class debates and others. We believe that
language learning should be authentic, relevant, and meaningful. Our lessons
are designed to connect language to students' daily lives, fostering both
functional use and cultural appreciation. Students deepen their understanding
of their heritage through festive celebrations and the annual Mother Tongue
Fortnight organized by the department.</p>
