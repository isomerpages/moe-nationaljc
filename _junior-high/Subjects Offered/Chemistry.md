Using Chemistry as an investigative tool, we will go on an exciting journey with opportunities to have a taste of what it feels like to be in the shoes of various occupations ranging from forensic scientists to food analysts. Utilising concepts and techniques in Chemistry, students enhance their problem solving skills to resolve issues which are pertinent to improve our everyday lives.
