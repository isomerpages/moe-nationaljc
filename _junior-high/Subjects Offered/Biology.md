### Biology

It often goes unnoticed that the physiological processes necessary to keep the human body healthy and in balance, require an incredible number and diversity of molecules. Students will look at how essential elements come together to generate the diversity of molecules which form the basics of biological systems and how these molecules are organised to form a cell and the roles they play. Equipped with these knowledge, students will then learn about the anatomy (study of body structure) and physiology (study of body parts’ functions) of the human body, to explore an important theme in Biology – “Continuity of Life”.  Students should recognise and be able to explain the importance of interactions between the different body systems in maintaining dynamic Physiological constancy even when the external environment changes.
