The Junior High Science Programme aims to develop students as Self-regulated learners and Critical thinkers, who appreciate the Interconnectedness between Science and the world through Experiential learning on the Nature of Science (NoS), who contribute to the society as Concerned citizens and Enthusiastic lifelong learners.

To this end, we employ VanTaseel-Baska’s Integrated Curriculum Model in the design of our Year 1 to Year 4 Junior High Science curriculum, focusing on content advancement, authentic learning process and product work, intra and interdisciplinary concept development. Our JH Science curriculum is anchored in the Practices of Science, which includes demonstrating Ways of Thinking and Doing (WOTD), understanding the Nature of Scientific Knowledge (NOS) and relating Science-Technology-Society-Environment (STSE). Besides looking forward to embarking on STEM learning experiences, our students will have valuable and meaningful opportunities to explore how big transferable ideas can transcend context, location and time, how they can hone their learn-to-learn and self-mastery skills as well as gain greater appreciation for collaboration!

  
  

The Junior High Science curriculum consists of the following modules:

  

Integrated Sciences

The Integrated Sciences programme at Lower JH seeks to equip our students with important practices of Science and a solid foundation of scientific concepts for the development of the three Science disciplines in Upper JH. Recognising diversity and patterns in the world, appreciating the use of models to aid our understanding of various phenomena, understanding interactions and relationships in the world, as well as learning about how different elements in various systems contribute and are interconnected, we will explore Science through various learning experiences. Through appreciating the nature of Science and learning the ways of thinking and doing Science, we continue to be curious and inquisitive about the world around us through opportunities to investigate and reason.![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/N9MupUVILIiguIyucxmjyvvb978YtOBZfXhunc7mg7yJom4s1AjcySFlavDbAPZ4oUQ2zZbDPciJ-4YaIwYeH7ksmQPg-tbc4Dczr6aowixsPU_b5i_m24rhnfBGeGDJQo9Hzi2XpSpyjEkDNJB69g)

In the Upper JH years, our students will work towards understanding Chemistry at a fundamental level. Using Chemistry as an investigative tool, we will go on an exciting journey with opportunities to have a taste of what it feels like to be in the shoes of various occupations ranging from forensic scientists to food analysts. Through team-based learning experiences and experiential learning, our students can utilise the concepts and techniques in Chemistry to enhance their problem solving skills to resolve issues which are pertinent to improve our everyday lives.![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/U0koF0PKt2CbVSlYQrceabxJndN6ChTkRcPHjY_1j2sqSg8CsP4_cA1RgNzsQDGEWx0bGMKbJSGLECE07IKiyfAx5452lHMhgjsG-cofimlIxHQrixbjSN6R3OG-xd6wZw7BKE670qmX8bpDgl8RdQ)

Physics

The study of Physics aims for us to better understand and appreciate the natural world around us. Adopting a scientific lens and equipping young minds to investigate, evaluate and reason critically, we will explore and question phenomena that early philosophers and physicists faced. From the study of Newton’s great contribution in the development of mechanics to the exploration of the exciting discoveries in electromagnetism, we will engage in a variety of experiential learning activities to understand how things work and see the relevance of Physics in our lives. ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tDhyxoa6O7qcSYBuAt_ULC7lPnVa0tHRNDRnZBAMgtjex1liq48Y03fsKa7Tv_a_VtGmtxAwheIA2HnlYlJaWXJG7O35e-vjtVepKG7CnyvApE2qzEIXUCZ744q5MdMvqJiEfxGHLafDdPkGgCJPGA)![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7SZYh33jX1EKFPZaud5-XedqGWGx5aBwX34I2gLwsrocfKpu0LCv8baVRBmcd7u5Vp2xheZrTKr4yXcajAUtrqnFv1ho-p711yxqLSjexSViXaSCZAIghGWgAdUM75s-ZyhdUuwHa6F0NbdFxp_fNw)

Biology

It often goes unnoticed that the physiological processes necessary to keep the human body healthy and in balance, require an incredible number and diversity of molecules. We will look at how essential elements come together to generate the diversity of molecules which form the basics of biological systems and how these molecules are organised to form a cell and the roles they play. Equipped with this knowledge, our students will then learn about the anatomy (study of body structure) and physiology (study of the functions of body parts) of the human body, to explore an important theme in Biology – “Continuity of Life”. Our students should recognise and be able to explain the importance of interactions between the different body systems in maintaining dynamic Physiological constancy even when the external environment changes.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/o1vhTFdrUjZdfsUFCjoyUar6XlYUDdnQHAJ7TJOPtnAY4_0UghBs5veXwySvle1CXg3eXmogAyB5g6Bm0MYt51R-VDwHm4HqgmPAUntTI5PgSMOfAJ07kxn6AqI8cXWQjJPtKpK-X3CGs2pbPg__iw)![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NVHn4txhOOQ2DvaBMET5erBjd3aJnzwMARd0yPwEnCuAjkoiTjoTVtYEWSQ1C4IM4ZRUIlcj8J1M4vVG0rq6yuS2Gjpbu7ZIv7-WYo2D5INdTa4UAGVnT5vgrBpfJzLlcXFfkJUi2F9xCilmn00TEw)

Students will explore the breadth and depth of the different fields of science, giving them the room to deepen their interests while retaining a broad view of the subjects. These opportunities are provided in the form of hands-on workshops and through seminar style discussions. Students will sharpen their skills of science communication to bring across difficult scientific ideas to different target audiences through a variety of learning experiences ranging from presentations to competitions. This module is offered to selected students who have demonstrated exceptional ability and potential in Science.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/albtYlq2sXfI2bn2xf4WCL-IK7GuJ2aPYsE9RKnA6cyU5qBxXO7dNIe6hQEt6Y23Qo8y5M_TpDsDq2PzSjHv7LEC22s0ctjt5lKa1pjav7gFDwzTBRNrpS7Ht-jFmDp_tbB9T6nk39eXOy7YeWT0hA)

How do I join Advanced Science (Adv Sci)?

*   All JH2 students will be briefed on Adv Sci (i.e. what to expect, desired attributes, selection process).
    
*   Besides looking out for students who possess a desired set of attributes and are excelling academically, teachers’ recommendations and suitability assessments will be considered and performed during the selection process.
    
*   Selected students may exercise their choice to select Adv Sci as an elective during the JH3 subject combination exercise at the end of JH2
    

\*Exceptions, if any, will be considered on a case-by-case basis.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NzK9Q_u-XecBe5dG3A6tIHJGLgNr4qD8-IptrZ1bR9SBjVv_TubwaIjnsshhLeqmSsgteUwWuVU2N1rIJSOPbxR6FtDL8142mfCP7LWpuzO9SF7djAiEHZ08lLh2QPsX1bIFt8ayg2-9kKjaQ-stT-Q)
