### Thinking

The Thinking modules in the lower JH levels help students develop metacognition and draw their attention to the patterns and processes of thinking, so that they are better able to replicate helpful thinking practices in their other subject classes.

Those who wish to and are able to, proceed to further explore critical thinking in different areas in Man and Ideas. Using enquiry as the approach to learning, MI engages students in questioning, challenging assumptions and known knowledge, exploring what they do not yet know, and in so doing, make them better thinkers and decision-makers.
