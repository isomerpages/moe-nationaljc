Students can take a selection test for enrolment in the Advanced Inquiry in Mathematics (AIM) Programme in JH1. Entry to the programme in other levels is based on performance in the main mathematics curriculum as well as tutorsâ€™ recommendation. Through the programme, students get the opportunities to deepen their knowledge in Mathematics, evoke their curiosity through research and competitions, and also foster greater confidence through presentations in exhibitions, overseas exchanges and symposiums.

Students would start off with competition mathematics, while picking up computing and mathematical modelling skills. In the second phase, they would embark on Independent Study Modules on topics including Combinatorics and Graph Theory. Finally, they would get exposed to more advanced topics like Number Theory and Group Theory under the guidance of tutors.
