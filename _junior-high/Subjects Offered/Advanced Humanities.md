<h1><strong>Advanced Humanities</strong></h1>
<p><strong>“The arts and the humanities teach us who we are and what we can be.” - Ronald Reagan</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>What is Advanced Humanities?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Advanced Humanities is a 2-year programme that offers an interdisciplinary
Humanities curriculum at JH3s and JH4s which allows students to make connections
between the different subjects, as well as to what is happening in the
real world. Students take this as an additional subject on top of History
or Geography, and Governance and Society, in Upper JH.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>What do we do in AH?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We employ a modular approach that includes fieldwork, where students work
on project topics that they craft together with their mentors that allow
them to engage in the real life application of knowledge. The modules we
offer are constantly updated in line with current trends and student interest.
Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The evolution of the disciplines: Historiography and Geographic Thought&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model United Nations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heritage and Culture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geopolitics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research Studies&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As an extension to the Research Studies module, all AH students are also
given the opportunity to take part in international Research Exchange Programmes
(IREPs) with our overseas partner universities, as well as the MOE Humanities
and Social Sciences Research Programme (HSSRP), which provides participants
with the opportunity to engage in research under the guidance of university
professors in the various fields in the Humanities and Social Sciences,
who act as mentors to the students’ project. Other platforms where our
students present their research projects include NJC’s very own biannual
International Humanities Symposium.</p>
