<p><strong><em>“Education should be the handmaid of citizenship.” – Calvin Coolidge&nbsp;</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The NJC curriculum for Governance and Society (GS) aims to cultivate informed,
concerned and participative citizens of tomorrow. We seek to help our students
better understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world we
live in, to appreciate the complexities of the human experience, and to
develop civic and global literacies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drawing on aspects of society that are of meaning and interest to the
students, our GS module seeks to ignite students’ curiosity to inquire
into real-world issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic
learning experiences, students will attain relevant knowledge and understanding
about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and
appreciate multiple perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>GS in NJC is offered at Upper JH levels. The Parallel Curriculum Model
framework is adopted, where the core curriculum of Upper Secondary Geography
and History are extended to create a curriculum of connections between
the different subjects. This pushes students to look for relationships
among disciplines, time, location, and perspectives - and see that all
knowledge is connected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At JH3, students explore the concepts of identity, diversity, harmony,
citizenship, and governance. This fosters a deep understanding of the values
that define Singapore society, what it means to be a citizen of Singapore,
and heighten awareness of the need to develop personal and collective responsibility
to promote and maintain harmony in a diverse society like Singapore.</p>
<p>At JH4, students explore the broad concept of globalisation in relation
to the concepts already covered at JH3. This module aims to make meaning
of living&nbsp; in a globalised world, where countries, companies and individuals
are interconnected and interdependent. We also examine how the uneven impacts
of globalisation result in trade-offs and tensions, leading to varying
responses from countries, organisations and individuals. Through this,
we hope to help students appreciate the complex decision-making processes
behind responses towards the impacts of globalisation, and begin to see
that making well-reasoned and responsible decisions as informed, concerned
and participative citizens in a globalised world, will secure Singapore
and the world's future.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>
</p>
<p>GS modules are assessed via coursework, where students are expected to
apply the knowledge they have into an authentic experience. In this way,
students are given the opportunity to bring their learning to life as authentic
practitioners, thus allowing our students to extend the classroom, connect
with the community, and develop expertise in what they have studied. To
enhance students’ 21st century competencies such as collaboration and communication
skills, projects are done collaboratively, and students are given opportunities
to present their findings at the end of the project&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another important component of GS is personal reflection. Through reflecting
on their learning experiences, we hope to help the students further their
self-understanding, be meta-cognitive in their learning, and make meaning
of their learning.</p>
