<p><strong><em>“The study of Geography is about more than just memorising places on a map. It’s about understanding the complexity of our world, appreciating the diversity of cultures that exists across continents, And in the end, it’s about using all that knowledge to help bridge divides and bring people together”</em></strong>

<p><strong><u>NJC Geography</u></strong> seeks to empower students to become
global citizens with an understanding of Earth’s varied environments, both
human and natural. Through an inquiry based learning approach, students
learn how humans can live on Earth in a sustainable manner. NJC Geography
students are imbued with a sense of wonder and curiosity about the world
in which they live, and a feeling of awe and respect for the environment
surrounding them, as well as the capacity to be self-regulated and critical
in their mastery of the subject.</p>
<p><strong><u>Junior High Geography Curriculum:</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In the Junior High (JH) campus, all students will read Geography in JH1
and JH 2. They will decide at the end of JH2 whether to pursue Geography
in Upper JH.</p>
<p>JH Geography is issue-based learning, where students’ curiosity are sparked,
and they collect and analyse data and reflect on their learning.</p>
<p>The Lower JH module begins by introducing students to what Geography is
all about, tapping on the various tools used by geographers such as maps,
cool satellite imagery and unique fieldwork techniques. With these, students
can then use their geographical lenses to explore Singapore’s unique tropical
rainforest. The next section of the module looks at an important feature
of this tropical climate - water. We explore the ways in which water moves
about in an area and study the significance of water to humans.</p>
<p>The students are then introduced to the twists and turns of urban living.
Students will explore the challenges faced by cities in trying to meet
the needs of their inhabitants. Using case studies from around the world,
students will learn how various strategies have been adopted by different
cities in overcoming the challenges they encounter in the context of urban
living.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Upper JH module begins by introducing 3 key themes from Physical Geography:
Groundbreaking --- Plate Tectonics, Coastal Studies and Weather and Climatic
Hazards: An Insurmountable Challenge. Students explore physical processes
that shaped the resultant phenomena and landforms&nbsp; as well as how
humans try to tame these physical processes and phenomena. This is followed
by 3 key themes from Human Geography: Geography of Tourism, Food Resources,
and Health &amp; Diseases. In the light of the growing world population,
these 3 themes explore the challenges of environmental sustainability.
A central concept that runs through these 3 themes is variation in development
(poverty).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Extension of Learning:</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The JH Geography Curriculum also includes field trips to carry out Geographical
Investigations. This includes local trips to Bishan Park and Changi Village.
Self-directed Geographical Investigations in Chinatown and their local
neighbourhood as well within the NJC campus.</p>
