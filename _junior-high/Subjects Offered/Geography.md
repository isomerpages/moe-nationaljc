_“The study of Geography is about more than just memorising places on a map. It’s about understanding the complexity of our world, appreciating the diversity of cultures that exists across continents, and in the end, it’s about using all that knowledge to help bridge divides and bring people together”    –_  Barack Obama

_“Geography is the subject that holds the key to the future”   –_  Michael Palin

Geography seeks to empower students to become global citizens with an understanding of Earth’s varied environments, both human and natural. Through an inquiry based learning approach, students learn how humans can live on Earth in a sustainable manner. Our students are imbued with a sense of wonder and curiosity about the world in which they live, and a feeling of awe and respect for the environment surrounding them, as well as the capacity to be self-regulated and critical in their mastery of the subject.

In the Junior High, all students will read Geography in JH1 and JH 2. They will decide at the end of JH2 whether to read Geography at the Upper JH. JH Geography is issue-based learning, where students’ curiosity is sparked, and they collect and analyse data and reflect on their learning. The Lower JH module begins by introducing students to what Geography is all about, tapping on the various tools used by geographers such as that of maps, cool satellite imagery and unique fieldwork techniques. With these, students can then use their geographical lenses to explore Singapore’s unique tropical rainforest. In the next section of the module we explore the ways in which water moves about in an area and study the significance of water to humans. Students are then introduced to the twists and turns of urban living. They will explore the challenges faced by cities in trying to meet the needs of their inhabitants. Using case studies from around the world, students will learn how various strategies have been adopted by different cities in overcoming the challenges they encounter in the context of urban living.

The Upper JH module begins by introducing 3 key themes from Physical Geography: Groundbreaking — Plate Tectonics, Coastal Studies and Weather and Climatic Hazards: An Insurmountable Challenge. Students explore physical processes that shaped the resultant phenomena and landforms as well as how humans try to tame these physical processes and phenomena. This is followed by 3 key themes from Human Geography: Geography of Tourism, Food Resources, and Health & Diseases. In the light of growing world population these 3 themes explore the challenges of environment sustainability. A central concept that runs through these 3 themes is variation in development (poverty).

The JH Geography Curriculum also includes field trips to carry out Geographical Investigations. This include local trips to Bishan Park and Changi Village. Self-directed Geographical Investigations in Chinatown and their local neighbourhood as well within the NJC campus. At JH4, an overseas field-trip is organised for selected students as an extension of learning.
