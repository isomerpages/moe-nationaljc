In STEAM@NJC, we seek to nurture the next generation of collaborative innovators and problem solvers with strong empathy, resilience, creativity and curiosity to learn.

Here in STEAM@NJC, students have access to a wide array of opportunities for development in needs analysis, various technological applications (such as 3D-printing and robotics), product design, technology management and exposure to actual industrial problem solving strategies. With these broad based and rich experiences, STEAM@NJC students are compassionate, resilient and versatile collaborative problem solvers for the world of today and tomorrow.
