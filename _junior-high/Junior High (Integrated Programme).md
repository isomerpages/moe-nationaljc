### Junior High (Integrated Programme)

Our Junior High offers a 6-year educational programme which is customised for ability-driven, broad-based and inter-disciplinary application learning with a strong emphasis on independence, character development and national education.

Our curriculum philosophy is to nurture deep learners, critical and collaborative thinkers, and active citizens who aspire to add value to the lives of others, in line with our motto Service with Honour. At the core of this integrated programme are the principles of key talent-development curriculum models used in todayâ€™s educational landscape.

To achieve this, we offer a range of subjects to all Junior High students, and these foreground the inter-disciplinary connections between each subject to enable our students to gain a holistic view of knowledge and transfer their learning to the real world. Milestone research programmes for all students -- SPIRE and STEAM -- further provide opportunities for students to work collaboratively to hone their knowledge, skills and competencies in various domains. 

In addition, our lower Junior High curriculum incorporates Thinking and Drama. Upper Junior High students can look forward to opportunities to pursue Advanced Science, Advanced Inquiry in Mathematics, Advanced Humanities, Advanced Language Arts and Man &amp; Ideas. 

Our curricular offering underscores our desire to develop each child to his/her fullest potential, and to be well-equipped for the future of learning and work.
