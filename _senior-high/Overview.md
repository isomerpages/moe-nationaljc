### Senior High

The Senior High curriculum equips every NJCian with skills and knowledge that will put them in good stead to lead, serve and add value to the lives of others. Prospective Senior High students can look forward to a variety of learning experiences through the range of instructional approaches designed to engage and excite students in learning.Â 

Beyond the knowledge base of the A-Level curriculum, Senior High students have abundant opportunities to identify their gifts and develop their talents, ranging from overseas Values-in-Action and research experiences, to local industrial and IHL attachments, through to leading NJCians and the community in various enterprising initiatives.
