### Subject Combinations

In NJC, we offer subject combinations that favour your interest towards certain subjects.

At the same time, these specific combinations will get you your desired courses in universities, be it local or international.

**MOE Policy on Subject Combination**

The ‘A’ Level Curriculum, as a pre-university course, ensures that students have a good grounding across various disciplines, and develop critical thinking, process and communication skills.

Admission to universities is determined by discipline-specific pre-requisites and the University Admission Score (UAS). The UAS is computed based on performance in three H2 subjects, one\*&nbsp;H1#&nbsp;subject, General Paper (GP) and Project Work (PW).

\* If a student reads four H2 subjects, the lowest performing H2 subject will be computed as a H1 subject. If a student reads KI as one of the four H2 subjects, he/she will be exempted from reading GP and KI will be recomputed as one H1 subject and GP for UAS.

\# The curriculum time for H1 subjects is approximately half that of H2 subjects., e.g. H1 Economics runs for 2 hours a week or approximately 100 hours for 2 years and H2 Economics runs for 4 hours a week or approximately 200 hours for 2 years.

1.  Students may select subjects at three different levels of study: Higher 1 (H1), Higher 2 (H2) and Higher 3 (H3). A student may not offer the same subject at both H1 and H2.
2.  Every student will offer a combination of H1 / H2 / H3 subjects + MTL. The number of academic units computed is: Minimum (Norm): 9 + 1 (H1 MTL), Maximum: 11 + 1 (H1 MTL)
3.  All students must take Mother Tongue (MTL) at H1 unless they have obtained a minimum of D7 for Higher MTL at ‘O’ Level, in which case, they need not take H1 MTL and may use their ‘O’ Level HMTL results for university admission score computation with rebasing. However, the H1 MTL unit cannot be replaced by another content unit (except for students who offer H2 MTLL in lieu of H1 MTL).
4.  Students who select H2 Mother Tongue Language and Literature (MTLL) in lieu of H1 MTL will not have any H1 MTL component in the computation of units for admission to local universities. However, the maximum number of academic units that they may offer is 10 + 2 (H2 MTLL, inclusive of the H1 MTL unit).
5.  All students must select either H1 General Paper (GP) or H2 Knowledge and Inquiry (KI).
6.  All students must take H1 Project Work (PW).
7.  All students must select at least 4 content-based subjects. E.g. 3 H2 1 H1.One of the content-based subjects must be of a contrasting disciplineE.g. a Science course (Science and Mathematics) must include an Arts subject (Knowledge Skills, Languages, Humanities and the Arts)
8.  All students may be offered at most two H3 subjects.
9.  One academic unit is used for each H1 or H3 subject offered; two academic units are used for each H2 subject offered.

**NJC Internal Policy on Subject Combination**

1.  The list of subject combinations and their respective pre-requisites are listed in the graphic below.
2.  Students must meet two sets of pre-requisites:
        *   The pre-requisite to read a specific subject (see table below)
        *   The pre-requisites to read a specific combination (see graphic below)
