### Subject Combinations

In NJC, we offer subject combinations that favour your interest towards certain subjects.

At the same time, these specific combinations will get you your desired courses in universities, be it local or international.

**MOE Policy on Subject Combination**

The ‘A’ Level Curriculum, as a pre-university course, ensures that students have a good grounding across various disciplines, and develop critical thinking, process and communication skills.

Admission to universities is determined by discipline-specific pre-requisites, attempt of Project Work (PW) and the University Admission Score (UAS). The UAS is computed based on performance in ^three H2 subjects and General Paper (GP).

\^ A student must read minimally three H2 subjects and one #H1 content subject. If a student reads four H2 subjects, the lowest performing H2 subject will be computed as a H1 subject. The H1 content subject may be considered in the computation for UAS if it improves the UAS with rebasing.

\# The curriculum time for H1 subjects is approximately half that of H2 subjects., e.g. H1 Economics runs for 2 hours a week or approximately 100 hours for 2 years and H2 Economics runs for 4 hours a week or approximately 200 hours for 2 years.

1.  Students may select subjects at three different levels of study: Higher 1 (H1), Higher 2 (H2) and Higher 3 (H3). A student may not offer the same subject at both H1 and H2.
2.  Every student will offer a combination of H1 / H2 / H3 subjects + MTL. The number of academic units computed is: Minimum (Norm): 7 + 1 (H1 MTL), Maximum: 11 + 1 (H1 MTL)
3.  All students must read H1 General Paper (GP) , Project Work (PW) and Mother Tongue Language (MTL).
4.  All students must take Mother Tongue (MTL) at H1 unless they have obtained a minimum of D7 for Higher MTL at ‘O’ Level, in which case, they need not take H1 MTL and may use their ‘O’ Level HMTL results for UAS computation with rebasing. However, the H1 MTL unit cannot be replaced by another content unit (except for students who offer H2 MTLL in lieu of H1 MTL).
5.  All students must attempt PW at Senior High 1.
6.  Students who select H2 Mother Tongue Language and Literature (MTLL) in lieu of H1 MTL will not have any H1 MTL component in the computation of units for admission to local universities. However, the maximum number of academic units that they may offer is 10 + 2 (H2 MTLL, inclusive of the H1 MTL unit).
7.  All students must read at least FOUR content-based subjects, three of which have to be at H2 and at least one of the content-based subjects must be of a contrasting discipline.
8.  All students may be offered at most two H3 subjects.
9.  Apart from H3 Research, all other H3 subjects may only be offered in Senior High 2.
11.  One academic unit is used for each H1 or H3 subject offered; two academic units are used for each H2 subject offered.
