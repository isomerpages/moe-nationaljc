Chemistry is the discipline interested in explaining and discovering more about the fundamental building blocks of what makes our world the way it is. Through this course, students will be able to explain properties of substances, as well as the kinds of transformations they go through when they come into contact with others. Utilising a variety of teaching modes, materials and hands-on demonstration to better engage students and also to communicate the importance of this building block to daily life.

In NJC, we seek to understand our natural world around us through carefully orchestrated blend of bite-size interactive learning activities, seminars, tutorials and practical tasks. Students can also look forward to our in-house enrichment programme and/or customised training for competitions (e.g. Olympiads), exploration and deepening of interest, satisfying their curiosity about the natural world from a microscopic lens.
