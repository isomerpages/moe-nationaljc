<p><strong><em>“The study of Geography is about more than just memorising places on a map. It’s about understanding the complexity of our world, appreciating the diversity of cultures that exists across continents, And in the end, it’s about using all that knowledge to help bridge divides and bring people together”</em></strong>

<p><strong><u>NJC Geography</u></strong> seeks to empower students to become
global citizens with an understanding of Earth’s varied environments, both
human and natural. Through an inquiry based learning approach, students
learn how humans can live on Earth in a sustainable manner. NJC Geography
students are imbued with a sense of wonder and curiosity about the world
in which they live, and a feeling of awe and respect for the environment
surrounding them, as well as the capacity to be self-regulated and critical
in their mastery of the subject.</p>
<p><strong><u>Senior High Geography Curriculum:&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Senior High Geography curriculum is guided by what is laid out in
the Cambridge ‘A’ Level syllabus. Students will learn about tropical environments
and their variations across space and time, development across the global
economy and how it can be mapped out both spatially and temporally, as
well as sustainable development and the ways in which it can be achieved
in different places. Reference is often made to case studies across the
world, both past and present. These include the thriving city of Shenzhen
to the islands of Maldives and the economic prowess of Royal Dutch Shell,
as well as the Atacama Desert in South America today to the Lake Megachad
in North Africa more than 10,000 years ago. In reading Senior High Geography,
students are imbued with the ability to understand the place of space,
scale, time, process, environment, interconnections and systems in making
sense of the world around them.</p>

<p><strong><u>Extension of Learning:&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Students are often engaged in various activities beyond the classroom.
As part of their curriculum, students conduct geographical investigations
in various neighbourhoods, and parks such as Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. They
are also given the opportunity to participate in local learning journeys
to places such as the Singapore City Gallery at Urban Redevelopment Authority,
and take part in competitions such as the Challenge for the Urban and Built
Environment (CUBE) competition.</p>
