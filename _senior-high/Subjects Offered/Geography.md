**_“The study of Geography is about more than just memorising places on a map. It’s about understanding the complexity of our world, appreciating the diversity of cultures that exists across continents, and in the end, it’s about using all that knowledge to help bridge divides and bring people together”_** **_\-Barack Obama-_**             

The NJC Senior High Geography curriculum is guided by the Cambridge ‘A’ Level syllabus. Students will learn about tropical environments and their variations across space and time, development across the global economy and how it can be mapped out both spatially and temporally, as well as sustainable development and the ways in which it can be achieved in different places. Reference is often made to case studies across the world, both past and present. These include the thriving city of Shenzhen to the islands of Maldives and the economic prowess of Royal Dutch Shell, as well as the Atacama Desert in South America today to the Lake Megachad in North Africa more than 10,000 years ago. In reading Senior High Geography, students are imbued with the ability to understand the place of space, scale, time, process, environment, interconnections and systems in making sense of the world around them.

Students are often engaged in various activities beyond the classroom. As part of their curriculum, they are often required to conduct geographical investigations in neighbourhoods such as Chong Pang, and parks such as Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. They are also given the opportunity to participate in local learning journeys to places such as the Singapore City Gallery at Urban Redevelopment Authority, as well as overseas trips to Malaysia and even Hong Kong.
