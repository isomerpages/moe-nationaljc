### General Paper

General Paper takes students on a journey that goes beyond the accumulation of current affairs knowledge. It is essentially a study of the complex world that we inhabit and through it, aims to develop in students a keen, critical eye with which to view the world.

The General Paper course in NJC is designed to bring excitement into the classroom through the introduction of films, music and enrichment activities which expose students to critical issues and global happenings. We aim to make learning relevant and authentic and ultimately, inspire our students to become lifelong learners. The syllabus involves a thematic progression from the personal to the global, enabling students to better appreciate their place in relation to the world. Apart from honing their writing skills, the seminar-style approach in our classrooms give them ample opportunities to speak up and engage others with their opinions.
