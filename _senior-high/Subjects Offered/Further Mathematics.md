H2 Further Mathematics is designed for students who are mathematically-inclined and who intend to specialise in mathematics, sciences or engineering or disciplines with higher demand on mathematical skills. To be taken with H2 Mathematics and a contrasting subject, Further Mathematics extends and expands on the range of mathematics and statistics topics in H2 Mathematics and provides these students with a head start in learning a wider range of mathematical methods and tools that are useful for solving more complex problems in mathematics and statistics.

Students taking Further Mathematics can expect opportunities for peer teaching and learning through small group discussions to connect ideas within mathematics and apply mathematics in the contexts of sciences, engineering and other related disciplines as well as to  develop thinking, reasoning, communication and modelling skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving. Students get to experience and appreciate the rigour and abstraction in the discipline.
