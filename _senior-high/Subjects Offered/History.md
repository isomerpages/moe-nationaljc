</p>
<p><strong>Aims and Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>History seeks to empower students to become global citizens through an
appreciation of how past events have shaped the world we live in today.
Through an inquiry-based learning approach, students encounter and empathise
with different perspectives and interpretations of the past, and learn
to navigate their way in an uncertain and complex world. Through these
encounters, our students develop a sense of curiosity and wonder about
the world in which they live, and are encouraged to practice informed,
discriminating and active citizenship essential to building a society and
nation.</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>The Senior High History curriculum is guided by the Cambridge ‘A’ Level
syllabus. Through a seminar-style approach, we focus on issues-based discussions,
and utilise a concept-based curriculum that enables deep mastery and the
transfer of knowledge.</p>
<p>The A’ Level History syllabus focuses on developing students’ understandings
of the key forces that shaped major international and regional developments
of the twentieth century. Students will learn how the watershed of World
War II led to the start of the <u>Cold War</u>, an iconic conflict whose
effects still linger, and are arguably even resurgent, to this very day.
The Cold War, in turn, had profound impacts on the development of the <u>Global Economy</u>,
as well as <u>international security</u>, where the role of local players
interacted with external forces to shape the development of the international
order. In addition, students will also acquire a robust knowledge of Southeast
Asia by examining how its constituent nations’ <u>developed after independence</u>, <u>grew their economies, </u>and
dealt with <u>regional conflict and cooperation,</u> thus acquiring a holistic
understanding of how the politics, economics and society of the region
that shaped our past continue to manifest today.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Opportunities</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who demonstrate great passion and potential in the subject will
be selected to represent the college in various history competitions and
interschool seminars.</p>
