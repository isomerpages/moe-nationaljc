Mathematics at NJC encourages our students to pursue the subject of Mathematics beyond the syllabus. Beyond the role of a seeker in the subject with intellectual curiosity, students are learners who reflect and initiate their own learning process. Leveraging on various platforms to integrate their knowledge and skills, students are able to fully realise and apply their imagination and conceptions. We aim to imbue in students the skills and traits which are aligned with our desired outcome of a self-regulated learner, a problem solver, and an effective communicator.

Mathematics is a basic and important discipline that contributes to the developments and understandings of sciences and other disciplines via modeling, understanding and solving problems in the respective fields. With the complete set of essential mathematical skills and good metacognitive ability, students will be able to think strategically and reason mathematically to solve problems. Students will also learn to enhance their critical-thinking, analytical and problem-solving skills when faced with abstract and numerical problems. They will learn to assess the accuracy of methods used in mathematical tasks and also the soundness of conclusion drawn where an awareness of their own conceptual and numerical errors is also cultivated.
