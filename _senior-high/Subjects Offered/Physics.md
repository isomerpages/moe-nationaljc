     style="width:80%">

Physics develop in students an understanding that a small number of basic principles and core ideas can be applied to explain, analyse and solve problems in a variety of systems in the physical world. The curriculum builds on the foundation of secondary school Physics curriculum. Students will deepen their appreciation of familiar topics, such as dynamics and waves, through sophisticated models and methods. Besides classical physics, students will learn also learn theories developed in the 20th century such as Quantum Physics and Nuclear Physics.

Students will develop their disciplinary thinking through progressive strengthening of fundamental concepts, investigative skills and problem solving through a variety of tasks from simple handmade Physics demonstration sets, investigation of daily phenomena with videos to magnetic linear accelerator to strengthen the applications of Physics knowledge and skills. There are enrichment opportunities to deepen students’ appreciation of the subject through Physics enrichment camps organised by NTU and NUS, Singapore Physics Olympiad training and H3 Physics.
