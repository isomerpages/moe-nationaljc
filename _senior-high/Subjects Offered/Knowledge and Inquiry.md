### Knowledge and Inquiry

_“We know very little, and yet it is astonishing that we know so much, and still more astonishing that so little knowledge can give us so much power.”  Bertrand Russell_

Knowledge and Inquiry is a subject that focuses on the nature of knowledge and its construction in areas such as the sciences, the social sciences, and the aesthetics. Its application also requires higher-order critical thinking skills to analyse information and arguments for logic and validity. A key component of the KI course is the writing of an Independent Study, where individual students propose and write a research topic, in fulfillment of the course requirements.

In NJC, KI is taught seminar-style, inspired by the _agora,_ or marketplace, the centre of artistic, spiritual and philosophical life in the ancient city of Athens. Each lesson is a round-table dialogue of different perspectives based on well-founded theories of past and present philosophers. Students drive the pace and coverage of the lessons through self-study and regulation, and engage with each other through Socratic questioning.
