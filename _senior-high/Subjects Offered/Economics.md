Economics is a subject concerned with the efficient utilization or management of limited resources for the purpose of attaining maximum satisfaction of human material wants. Economics is a discipline that aims to develop in students the ability to use the tools of economic reasoning to explain, analyse and resolve economic issues; and evaluate perspectives and decisions of economic agents; cultivate the habit of reading critically, from a variety of sources; to gain information about the changing economic activities and policies at the national and international levels; and be able to use evidence in making well-reasoned arguments to arrive at rational and considered decisions. 

Seminar-style and tutorial-style teaching are adopted by the NJC Economics Department to enhance students’ learning. Students will be directed to specific pre-lesson readings to optimize their learning during in-class discussions. Students can expect opportunities to develop critical thinking, problem solving and presentation skills. Learning through small group discussions also create opportunities for students to develop 21st Century competencies.
