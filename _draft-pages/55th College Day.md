<p>In this 55th year of NJC’s founding, I am reflecting on the privilege
of belonging to this community of NJCian staff and students – past and
present – who are so passionate about life and learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The spirit of daring-do came across again and again in conversations with
members of the Class of 1969 and others who studied here in the 70s. When
they felt like having a bit more time in school to study and bond, a group
of boys stayed over and slept in their classroom for the whole term! With
the principal’s knowledge and approval of course. CCAs had to be invented
from scratch. Students taught each other how to dance, sing, play a sport
they’d never learned on the day of the competition itself. For me their
spirit captures something of NJ Life that is very special – I still see
students today trying new things they’ve never done before. May we all,
students, staff and parents have the courage to brave discomfort and embarrassment
in our thirst for learning and for life!</p>
<p></p>
<p>From cohorts in the 80s, 90s and 2000s, I learned the power of passionate
teaching as many of us reflected on the impact of the late Mr. Don Whitby
(NJC staff from 1979 to 2012). Mr. Whitby epitomised the fervent love of
his subject that is characteristic of so many generations of NJC teachers.
Colleagues who knew him were in tears when they learned of his passing
– so many of us became Literature teachers because of him. But strikingly
it was the alumni from the science classes whose memories of Mr. Whitby
were particularly poignant. They knew him as the person who brought them
into the world of theatre through ELDDS or coached them to succeed in the
dreaded GP subject. Mr. Whitby’s greatest joy was to encourage young people.
Captains of industry and leaders in public service, many of them, honour
him for where they are today. NJ Honour is the ‘name’ I give to this culture
of honouring our disciplines and encouraging learning which characterises
the teacher-student relationship in NJC.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Working alongside our NJCians and teachers over the years have been the
many alumni who give their time to return to mentor and inspire. To live
out our mission to be the College of the Nation, we will need to address
our hearts and minds to the problems that beset our nation and world today.
Alumni are key to this. To illustrate, despite their very busy schedule,
alumni like Prof Lim Chwee Teck (NJC’82) opened up his lab and came back
to share with NJCians the world of engineering and entrepreneurship, and
veteran educator and passionate mathematician, Dr Hang Kim Hoo (NJC’77)
brought our faculty through the traits called for in 21st century inventive
and adaptive thinking. NJ Research is the term I use to capture this spirit
of inquiry, problem-solving and constant curiosity embodied by alumni like
these which we are growing in today’s NJCians.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And from today’s NJCians, my own students, I am humbled constantly by
your attentiveness and purposefulness in what you do. I’ve seen this when
you study together and help your friends in their learning. In your VIAs
and as you work with your classmates to bring our biannual Funtasia Carnival
to life, I am struck by your heart for our friends with special needs whom
your efforts will benefit. I am so impressed with how you organise activities
to bring joy and new experiences to your peers – from the rich and memorable
Orientations you plan to events like Get Boulder, Talenttime and Friendship
Day. NJ Service truly is a way of life here at Hillcrest!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fellow NJCians, I hope that these snapshots of our community will add
on to your own memories of our 55th year and be an encouragement to you
as they have been to me.</p>

<p>In his speech at the Institute of Policy Studies Singapore Perspectives
2023, Minister Chan Chun Sing touched upon the Chinese saying “十年树木，百年树人”,
which translates to “10 years to grow a tree, a lifetime to grow a person”.
It signifies the importance of developing young people in our schools so
that they have the confidence and skills to keep on growing throughout
their lives. At NJC, we do this through our curriculum but, even more so,
through our community which comprises students, their parents, staff and
alumni.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This year, we celebrate both College Day and Funtasia, our College carnival,
on the same day. In tandem with Funtasia’s garden theme, we embrace this
notion of “Growing People, Cultivating the Future'' by reflecting on how
our college community must be a garden where our students’ curiosity is
nurtured and their skills are honed.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the soil of NJC’s deep relationships and rich learning experiences,
we want our students and alumni to keep on growing in the courage and commitment
to cultivate the future of our nation.</p>

<p>Receiving the Student of the Year Award is a great honour and I am immensely
thankful for everyone that has supported me along the way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Throughout my time in NJC, I’ve been blessed with the opportunity to meet
and learn from selfless and caring individuals from various backgrounds.
This incredible community of people has allowed me to develop a profound
appreciation for the value of service. I’ve come to understand that service
extends far beyond grand gestures or assuming prominent leadership roles
in the community. Instead, it encompasses every genuine action taken to
give back to those around us. From the simplest of things such as saying
a word of encouragement to a peer at the library, helping to take notes
for a classmate, or taking the initiative to keep equipment after Physical
Education lessons, these all exemplify what it means to serve with honour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To me, this award is more than just a recognition of my individual contributions.
Rather, it is a testament to the efforts of everyone that has helped me
grow into the person I am today. Moving forward, let us continue engaging
meaningfully with those around us and approach our society with empathy,
kindness and respect.</p>

<p>My journey at NJC has been defined by the ethos of ‘Service with Honour’,
instilling in me a deep sense of duty towards others. From participating
in class-initiated Values in Action (VIA) projects to taking on self-driven
initiatives, NJC has nurtured my commitment to serving the community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Volunteering not only allowed me to give back to the community but also
facilitated meaningful connections and enriched my understanding of diverse
perspectives. It sharpened my problem-solving and leadership skills, essential
for both volunteering and daily life challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Receiving the Lim Kim Woon Award is a profound honour, symbolising the
embodiment of NJC's values. It reaffirms the importance of service and
integrity in shaping individuals and communities. I am grateful for NJC's
guidance and support, which have empowered me to make a positive impact
and cultivate a future built on service and honour. I aim to continue with
this legacy in the future.</p>

</div>
<p>Entering NJC for the first time, I thought that “Service with Honour”
was just another cliché school motto. Little did I anticipate that six
years later, this phrase would hold so much meaning, shaping the way I
interact with others.</p>
<p>Whether it was the genuine support of fellow students before examinations&nbsp;
or the unwavering dedication of teachers who extended their guidance beyond
our academic pursuit, I learned firsthand how a simple act of kindness
can illuminate someone's day and even alter the course of their life.</p>
<p>Inspired by these acts of kindness, I wanted to serve others beyond our
school community. I am immensely grateful for the diverse volunteering
opportunities at NJC, which broadened my perspective and instilled in me
the belief that no change is too big or too small. It motivated me to make
a difference in our society with whatever capacity I possess.</p>
<p>I am deeply honoured to be receiving the Lim Kim Woon Award, and I am
very grateful to all those who have shown me what it truly means to Serve
with Honour. I am certain that NJC will continue to nurture student leaders
of the future, and I hope to inspire those around me to do the same as
well.</p>

<p>I am honoured to have received the Lim Kim Woon Award, and would like
to express my deepest sense of gratitude to the people in NJC who have
inspired and guided me throughout my journey.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>As Mahatma Gandhi once said, "The best way to find yourself is to lose
yourself through the service of others." Through my various volunteering
experiences, from small acts of kindness to college-wide initiatives, I
have managed to discover and improve myself. However, the greatest reward
from volunteering is the sense of fulfilment from seeing the smiles on
people's faces and the interactions with people from different backgrounds
that remind me what it means to be human.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>My experiences have taught me what it means to "serve with honour". It
is a way of life that involves empowering people out of pure compassion.
It is a long process of seeing your beneficiaries grow and develop till
they can support themselves. Most importantly, I believe that "serving
with honour" is something that is innate in us all. Cheering your friends
up, greeting someone with a smile - we all have the power to bring positive
changes into the lives of those around us.</p>
