<p>The Indoor Sports Hall (ISH) was progressively phased in as part National
Junior College’s vision to provide a holistic, well-rounded education to
all students in 2012. With greater flexibility to schedule Physical Education
(PE) lessons without having to worry about the weather, and give more students
the opportunity to participate in sports and games, the ISH can accommodate
a basketball court superimposed with four badminton courts, a volleyball
court and a netball court. In addition, it has an extension of about 30%
increase in court space as compared to a standardized sports hall which
allows for cohort based briefing and activities as an alternative to the
existing Hall and lecture facilities in the college. Our distinguished
alumnus donated a 3 by 2 meter state of the art mounted electronic scoreboard.</p>
