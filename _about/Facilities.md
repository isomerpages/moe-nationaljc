The new aesthetics block adds on to the current number of rooms specialised for the arts, with an additional 3 full mirror-walled dance studios, 3 classrooms for classroom teaching, 4 sound proof music rooms, proper storerooms for the instrumental groups and the 4 different dance groups, a foyer that welcomes visitors or opens to be a convenient space to practice dance moves or even instrumental parts and a large open roof top that is easily available for students to use for any purpose. NJC is also one of the few schools in Singapore that has its own black box theatre.
