<h5>Jeanette Aw</h5>
<p>A self-introduction has always been a challenging task for me. How do
I sum myself up in a few words? How do I share my career’s highlights with
all of you in as concise a manner as possible? How am I going to know what
is of interest to you?</p>
<p>I am Jeanette Aw. I have always loved music, art, and dance. I suppose
performing in front of an audience came as a natural next step when I chose
to major in Theatre Studies in NUS. Making the transition from stage to
television hasn’t exactly been easy. But 12 years down the road, I can
say it has been an amazing journey. Right now, I have a dream to return
to stage some day.</p>
<p>I believe in dreams. My very own book, “Jeanette Aw: Definitions”, being
one dream that came true for me. I do plan to continue writing. Words are
magical to me and I am given free rein to weave that little magic for myself
through my writing.</p>
<p>I do not intend to fill this page with frivolous things like height, weight,
languages spoken etc. However, these information are readily available
elsewhere I believe, accurate or not is another matter. I am fiercely protective
over my family and friends, so this is also something else I will not talk
about. What I refrain from saying opens up and magnifies another aspect
of me. So this section of the self-intro is not all lost.</p>
<p>I am not all that complicated. I am a simple person, a girl who wants
to lead a simple and happy life. I just listen to what the little voice
in my heart says and that is where it has led me to thus far. I just want
to keep my dreams alive and keep that fire burning for as long as I can.
Simple as that.</p>
<p>That is all for now. If you feel it is still not enough, you are most
welcome to read my blog and enter my world =)</p>
