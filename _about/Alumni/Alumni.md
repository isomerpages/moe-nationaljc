### Alumni

![](/images/alumni1.png)

The history of NJC Alumni dates back to 1975 when it was officially set up to foster closer links between the College and its former students. Since then, NJC Alumni played an active role in the College. For example, NJC Alumni participated in College functions such as College Day, annual dinners of which major commemorative ones were held every five-yearly and fund-raising activities for the betterment of the College.

The NJC Alumni Bursary Fund was set up in 1980 to provide financial assistance to needy students. This proactive initiative exemplifies the College’s motto “Service with Honour”.

The Alumni has also sub-groups under its wings, including the UK Chapter that was set up in 2011.     NJ Graduates Network (“NJGradNet”) is an initiative by a group in NJC Alumni to engage and connect with incumbent students. Started in 2018, NJGradNet was motivated by a desire to ensure that every aspiring student is afforded the support needed to achieve his/her tertiary and post-tertiary goals.
