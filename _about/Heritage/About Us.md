### About Us

<img src="/images/aboutus1.png" style="width:240px;height:180px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> **Our History**

14 May 1970 was a milestone in the development of education in Singapore. Officially opened by the then Prime Minister Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, National Junior College started off as the pioneer College in the Republic and our system has been the model for the junior colleges established in successive years.

Our College was established in 1969 with the aim of centralising the two-year pre-university course for all language streams with maximum utilisation of specialist personnel and resources. The academics, civics and co-curricular programmes are organised with the specific purpose of training and nurturing a new generation of alert and independent young minds with responsible and responsive social attitudes compatible with the Singapore milieu.

In keeping with our College’s name and philosophy, we claim no affiliation with any secondary school but instead draw our students from a wide spectrum. Each year about 60 Singapore secondary schools will have representatives amongst the College’s student population. Every student will have equal opportunity of attaining the highest levels of achievement in all fields.

**Our Crest**

The golden lion symbolizes Singapore. Red and white are the colours of the Republic of Singapore. White signifies pervading and everlasting purity and virtue.  Red is symbolic of universal brotherhood and equality of man.

The four white horizontal bars represent the four languages used in the Republic. The five red horizontal bars represent the five stars of the Singapore flag indicating the ideals of democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality.
