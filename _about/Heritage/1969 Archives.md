The 1969 Archives was officially opened on 5 August 2004. The Archives was set up

*   to present to visitors the College and current batches of students the rich heritage of NJC
*   to continue to maintain the bond between College and former students
*   to serve as a treasure trove of memories for former students.

Several names for the Archives were presented for voting by the staff and students and eventually ‘1969’ was chosen for it evokes a myriad of rich association with NJC’s beginning and its development over the years. 20 January, 1969 marked the opening of NJC with its inaugural assembly. Mr Lim Kim Woon was the first principal. In September that year, then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew visited the college.
