      <img src="https://file.for.edu.sg/college54mrslucytoh.png">      
			 <p>As I write this Foreword, half of Senior High One are experiencing six nights in our Boarding School. The other half did so in the last week of Term One. 300 of them hail from over 80 secondary schools across the island while 200 of them came to NJC four years ago from over 80 primary schools. In each of our six cohorts of students from Junior High One to Senior High Two, our student body is wonderfully diverse, echoing our Singaporean heritage – truly we are the College of the Nation.
				 
Today, like generations before them, these NJCians can once again put their arms around each other’s shoulders and sing their hearts out. No masks required. I take delight in knowing that the friendships they are forging will last a lifetime.

After months of collaborating and volunteering through internet platforms, once again, our students will go forth to learn and serve in-person. They will visit the elderly, teach younger learners, go to hospitals, research centres and more. 

As part of that learning, NJCians need to connect with alumni. That connection is vital to our sense of identity as privileged young people getting ready to serve our nation. Why? Because the NJC alumni are our role models.

This year, we are able to assemble together in the parade square. Covid-19 stole our voices. But we are learning again how to sing together. In the last stanza of our historic College Anthem –

<i>Marilah semua belia negara,  
Dengan semangat bakti semata;  
Satukan tenaga bertindak mara,  
Kita jayakan rakyat Singapura.</i>

As the youth of the nation, we are called to serve with energy and total dedication. We cannot do this individually. As one NJCian said to me recently, “I came here because of the feeling of family.” NJCians honour one another’s uniqueness and we serve each other. During these short and packed years, we will unite to answer a lifetime’s call to serve with honour all Singaporeans and lead our nation to success.

			<div>
				<p>Three years after the pandemic began, many new phrases have emerged – new-norm, pre-COVID times, zoom from home, HBL – to name a few.   We have acquired new skills for new ways of leading our everyday lives, ranging from teaching and learning to buying food.  We have become technologically-savvy but also technologically-dependent.  We have had to think more deeply and harder about disease and dis-ease.
				
What does it mean to live in these post-COVID times?  What must we ensure that we bring back from the days before?  What have we learned that might help us do better or do things differently?  Who are we and what do we want to become?  For this College Day, the NJC community aspires to:
		
<strong>Reconnect</strong> – Due to the many disruptions and safety restrictions, we have not been able to carry out activities that keep us connected to each other and to the wider community like  College-wide events, VIA, having alumni members back visiting etc.  How might we reconnect with our past (alumni) and our present (wider community)? 
		
<strong>Renew</strong> – NJC’s firm belief is that we serve with honour.  How might we renew our commitment to service and to developing ourselves to serve in future? To this end, we need to renew relationships that were forged but may have fallen by the wayside, and renew skills and knowledge which stand the test of time across a range of platforms both traditional and cutting-edge.
		
<strong>Reimagine</strong> – As we create a new future together, imbued with a stronger sense of awareness of the society as a community and a deeper knowledge of globalisation, let’s reimagine what honour means to the College.  Who or what do we honour?  How do we go about doing that?  Let’s have the courage  to not only be open to change and grow but eager to do so. 
		
Service with Honour!

			<h5>Student of the Year</h5>

			<p>I am deeply honoured to be selected as the Student of the Year. Despite what the name of the award may suggest, this is not an achievement of my own; neither is it reflective of my efforts of this past year alone.

This achievement is not just for the “me” today, but also the journey to get here. This recognition for me is an acknowledgement, not so much of any innate ability I may have, but of the continual pursuit of self-improvement. 

The student from 6 years ago could not have grown and changed so substantially as a person if not for the influence of those around me. The wisdom, inspiration and guidance of everyone on my NJ journey has not only ignited in me the desire to serve, but also provided me with the opportunity to give back meaningfully. 

Service is essentially about the impact you leave on other individuals, and I have been privileged to have been able to leave an impact on others in my time here. As much as this award commemorates the end of 6 years in NJC, it also marks a new beginning of serving beyond the college in the future.</p>

              <p>Service has always been a big part of what it means to be a NJCian. From the class-initiated VIA in JH1 to the self-initiated projects in the years onward, NJC has consistently reinforced in me a commitment to helping those in need. 

In my volunteering journey with NJC, I was motivated by a desire to not only give back to society, but also to engage with the community. Volunteering has given me the opportunity to make new connections and reinforce existing relationships, ultimately enabling me to learn from an even more diverse group of people than I would encounter in my daily life. Furthermore, volunteering has given me an opportunity to sharpen the skills required for problem-solving and people management, key skills not only in volunteering but in other aspects of my life. All in all, it is safe to say that service as an NJCian has allowed me to make an impact on not only other people’s lives, but also my own. 

I am honoured to have received the Lim Kim Woon Award, and I am very grateful for the people in NJC who have helped and inspired me on this journey.</p>

             <p>I am honoured to be receiving the Lim Kim Woon Award and grateful to teachers, staff, friends and family for believing in me.

My experience in NJC has been defined by filming food vlogs in the canteen, playing hide and seek at eighteen years old, befriending the school’s ‘aunties’ and ‘uncles’ and learning lessons from our teachers that extend far beyond our textbooks. These sweet memories of everyday life come together to form a chapter of my life.

This leads me to my interpretation of our school motto ‘Service With Honour’ and how it leads me to what this award means to me. Service with honour is about weaving kindness and compassion into daily life. At NJC, I saw individuals truly serving. Teachers stayed back for consultations, mentors supported my community projects and research endeavours and friends picked up calls when a question had me in tears.

I believe we do not need to make grand gestures to serve. Instead, even in small act of kindness - holding the door open, asking your elderly neighbour if she’s had a good lunch, checking in on our friends - we serve others with honour. To each of us, our life is our universe. And by even our smallest acts of kindness, we can add so much to another's world.</p>

<p>The Humanities have always been underappreciated, with its value lost and blanketed by our focus on STEM. We miss its importance, the Humanities’ relevance in nurturing empathy in our everyday selves. During trying times, it is the Humanities that pushes humanity on, through understanding one another’s troubles and sentiments, and reconnecting us to each other like in the pandemic. Despite physical distances that had left us feeling alone, there was a sense of unity and solidarity, helping to reconnect us in novel ways. 
Offering us a glimpse into the future, the Humanities help us reimagine our landscapes – both concrete and abstract. The hope that the Humanities provide us is essential in building our communities and nations, and even building ourselves up. We see ourselves in others and know we’re not alone or that different from others. With hope, we are able to believe in a better tomorrow, to push for change. Ultimately, the Humanities is for everyone, and we all have the power to shape our future through it. Between our fingers and thumb rests a squat pen, and I urge everyone to dig with it; to reimagine our future, renew, and rewrite the blueprints of our past’s tomorrow.</p>

<p>I am humbled and honored that my teachers nominated me for this award. It will motivate me to continue to work hard to bring success for the softball team. 
 
Being a sportsperson has taught me to incorporate feedback to improve, adapt to different situations and be able to think on my feet. In line with the College Day theme of reconnect, renew and reimagine: as a sportsperson playing in a team, I make sure to reconnect with the team, especially when new members join the team each year. I continually renew my skills in a constant pursuit of honing my skills in the game. As team captain, I make sure to reimagine what success looks like to me as a sportsperson and to my team.
 
No matter what curveballs may come my way, I am sure that NJ Softball will continue to swing and never stop believing in our ability to hit those curveballs as they come.</p>

<p>Being in NJ Basketball CCA over the past six years has been the biggest blessing to me. I have met many individuals who have helped shape me into the sportsman I am today: from coaches and teachers to teammates and seniors, these individuals have shown me the way in putting others before myself, and in caring for the people journeying both behind and alongside me.
 
I have come to appreciate how being a sportsman is more than just a tally of wins or even losses. In fact, I will no longer remember the scores as time passes. But what I will remember are the memories ingrained in my heart; of weal (e.g., travelling to Malaysia for training) and woe (e.g., crying together in tough times). These are the memories of NJ Basketball that will truly stick.</p>

<p>Take the opportunities that are presented to you and don’t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone! We can never know when things like Covid-19 or injuries will put us off the court. So be grateful for the opportunities that come our way and make the best of them. Always put your best foot forward and don’t be afraid to try! Continue dreaming big and chasing your dreams.

Winning this award has only made me more thankful for the things around me, for the support and opportunities NJC has given me. NJC has truly been an amazing place to be a student athlete and a leader who is not afraid to fail and come back stronger.</p>

<p>Winning this Sports Award has reminded me of the need to reconnect with the pure joy and passion that initially drew me to sports. The long hours of training, the sacrifices, and the perseverance: the moment of victory makes all these worth their while, reigniting my love for basketball.

This award has also inspired me to renew my commitment to basketball. Despite recent success and triumphs on the court, it is important to remain humble and continue to push myself to new heights. After all , complacency is the enemy of progress.

Most importantly, this award has made me realize how basketball is more than just personal achievements. Rather, it’s about the friendships I can make and the enjoyment of the game of basketball. Through basketball, I have met wonderful seniors in NJC who have motivated me to push myself further and enjoy my journey as a sportsperson.</p>

<p>The arts are fundamentally a study of human connections and relationships, and that has been no exception with my journey as a humanities student in NJC. Through the study of humanities, it’s been a wonderful experience to gain insight into ourselves as human beings. To me, this
award honours humanity itself, and what we can create. 
	
Humanities thrive on discourse. They thrive on discussions that prompt us to put on different lenses and attempt to understand that which may initially seem abstract, or even contrasting with our own views. Be it in unpacking communication through linguistics or the structures of our world through economics, my journey as an arts student has honed my ability to connect,
ironically through disconnection – conflict that prompted deeper introspection and appreciation for differences.

Beyond that, they are an exploration and expression of the self. As a writer myself, there is a salient understanding that beauty is often in the mundane, lying in plain sight. That can also be said for my journey as an arts student. It has truly been a humbling six years of learning and growing alongside my peers; and this award is a celebration of each and every one of us.</p>

<p>If not for NJC, I would probably not have had the confidence to take up subjects in the Arts. What a journey it has been for me, propelled by the passion of the teachers and students around me. Our classes often seemed like ‘lessons on life’ where we learnt to reflect on ourselves, the people around us, and the interactions between the two.  

Looking back, I have come to realise that the greatest value from this Arts adventure is not the academic results gained; rather, it is the skill of thinking more deeply about the world around us. If you are like me and find that the Humanities tug at your heart, I encourage you to pursue this interest further. The journey may not always be smooth-sailing, but it will be worth your while.</p>

<p>I am honored to be a recipient of the SAC Science Excellence Award. 

NJC has provided me with numerous opportunities to develop my interest in research, starting with the SPIRE programme in Secondary Two, which was what sparked my interest to begin with. Another notable opportunity was the International Research Exchange Programme (IREP). Through this programme, I had the privilege of collaborating with a group of Thai students on an analytical chemistry project, which broadened my perspective and deepened my understanding of science.

In Junior College 1, I participated in the H3 research programme where I worked on DNAzyme hybrid catalysts under Dr Liu Zhennan at A*STAR. This rigorous research programme advanced my knowledge in the field of organometallic catalysts. My hard work paid off when I presented my research and won the project of the year award at the ASEAN Student Science Project Competition 2022.

I would like to thank my research mentors, Ms Lee Shan Shan and Ms Lim Wei Li, as well as NJC's research and science departments for providing me with the various opportunities to explore my interest in research. Their guidance and support have been invaluable in my journey towards scientific excellence.</p>

<p>The pursuit of academic excellence is a journey that all of us trek together. Some love it, and some loathe it, but only we have the power to make our journey meaningful. To me, this college is a mystical place filled with adventures, and I chose to experience them with zest and positivity. NJC was where I had my first research experience, my first Student Council experience, and my first National School Games experience, and each of these taught me distinct, important life lessons – The first taught me how to learn, the second taught me how to empathise and the third taught me how to persevere.

You might wonder then, how did I embark on so many endeavours at once? Well, to be frank, I simply led with my heart. I invite everyone to do as I did and to spend your time in this college reconnecting with yourself, renewing your passions, and reimagining your reality. Find meaning in whatever you do, no matter how distant, and always give your all. The road ahead may not be smooth, but I guarantee that it will definitely be one of the most rewarding and enriching experiences you will have!</p>

<p>I am extremely honoured to receive the PAACT Aesthetics Excellence Award. Music is an integral part of my life, and stepping out of my comfort zone to play in many different orchestras has been eye-opening, as it allowed me to further hone my skills and acquire new experiences. However, being a musician has also been filled with ups and downs. The challenges that I faced were not easy to overcome but with the support of the people around me, I can look back on my journey thus far and say, "I have done it!". What matters the most was bouncing back from the numerous setbacks and doing my best for the audience and myself. NJC has offered me many “first experiences”, especially pertaining to my growth in the music domain. The teachers in NJCOGZ have given me the chance to lead the orchestra as student conductor which was a deep learning opportunity. My most valued takeaway is that music is not just a form of self-expression, but also an avenue for us to serve the community by sharing our music. This award will motivate me to become a better musician, and to continue working towards helping music reach everyone.</p>

<p>In the five years that I have spent with NJ Indian Dance, I have learnt invaluable lessons about myself, dance, leadership, and the interplay among the three.
	
When I first joined the CCA through DSA in Junior High 1, I was positively overwhelmed by the strong sisterhood of dancers and the number of new seniors I had utmost respect for. Years later, as I served my first term in the CCA’s Executive Committee, I was strongly guided by the same principles I had imbibed, such as discipline, drive, and order. Despite the solid grounding in values, the Covid pandemic hit me with a sense of burnout and loss of motivation. But the fundamental locus of passion and care that characterised NJID propelled me to discover new meaning in the leadership role I played. I shifted the focus of my leadership to serve with care, understanding, and love in mind, to enthuse the CCA amidst a bleak outlook with no ‘live’ and exciting performances to work towards. 
	
Having seen our dance team evolve, I believe it will and should continue to grow, adapting to whatever new circumstances we may face. May NJID’s core of passion and love continue to fuel growth!</p>

<p>To me, Economics has been, and will continue to be, an extremely fulfilling subject, challenging me to push myself intellectually, while simultaneously furthering my knowledge of the workings of the world around me. It has truly helped to reinvigorate my pursuit of academic excellence, and, ultimately, my personal growth in my journey as a student at NJC. 

To have my efforts recognised through the Yeong Wai Cheong Economics Award is a great honour, and motivates me to continue putting in my utmost effort into my studies. I have also begun to reimagine my personal goals and limits, as I now know that I am capable of greater heights than I had previously imagined. 

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my teachers and peers, my constant pillars of support and beacons of light in my past 5 years in NJC. From always guiding me through the tough times to celebrating the good times with me, I simply would not be where I am today without them.

<p>Receiving the Yeong Wai Cheong Economics Award provides me with a sense of pride and accomplishment. When I first embarked on the study of Economics in SH1, I found it challenging. While others seemingly managed to grasp concepts with ease, I always seemed to be a step behind. However, with the help of my teacher, I better appreciated Economics and learnt to overcome my difficulties by taking small but consistent steps. This award motivates me to continue striving for excellence, knowing that I have been recognised for my resilience in pursuing Economics.</p>

<p>To me, receiving the Yeong Wai Cheong Economics Award is a validation of the hard work I have put into improving myself, while also giving me the opportunity to further pursue Economics. Taking it up as a new subject, I had never expected to find myself as interested in Economics as much as the other subjects that I already enjoyed learning more about. However, as I dug deeper into the subject and come to understand it better with the help of my teacher, I discovered a newfound appreciation for the discipline. This award now serves as a reminder of this journey and pushes me to strive for greater heights, to continue my work with renewed energy and focus.</p>

<p>To me, Economics is a subject that teaches you how individuals, businesses and governments predict and develop new ideas to interact with fluctuating situations in the real world. Through Economics, I can better understand real-world conditions that help me in my future endeavours. 

The Yeong Cheong Wai Economics Award is a great encouragement and motivation for me to further explore the field of Economics as a possible career option. I would like to express my gratitude to my subject tutor in SH1, Mr Donavan Low, who sparked my interest and passion in Economics. 

# As the father of Macroeconomics John Maynard Keynes once said, “The Master-Economist must study the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future”. This is the goal that I am working towards.

<p>Life begins as a rivulet of water, coursing into rivers, into streams, usually flowing one-way towards the ocean. I am grateful for the people in National Junior College who allowed this rivulet to deviate, meander some distance upstream, and reconnect with the main flow there.

Receiving the Yeong Wai Cheong Economics Award is an affirmation that the potential foreseen in making this leap of faith is not mere mirage. The second attempt at SH1 gave me time to metamorphosize, as I chipped away at the cocoon of habits and circumstance calcifying into my being, and took a break from activities I liked but had little capacity for. Eventually, with greater presence of mind, I was able to rediscover the joy of pursuing knowledge that went beyond the textbooks, thus changing my life’s trajectory for the better.

Of course, this would not be possible without the warmth and support of the people around me. 

If you feel stuck, don’t be afraid to reconnect with yourself and reimagine how you can possibly achieve your dreams.

<p>Resilience and initiative: these are the two most important values everyone needs for their JC life to be a fulfilling one. When I first entered National Junior College, I was thrown a curveball. The workload was unlike anything I've experienced and it was difficult adapting to a new school environment. Being resilient during the initial uncertainty of Junior College life helped me cope with the rigour of academia and co-curricular activities and requirements. Moreover, realizing that I was not invincible and taking the initiative to seek help when needed propelled me to greater heights.

I'll be forever grateful to teachers and my classmates for putting up with the endless volley of questions I threw at them whenever I had doubts or learning gaps. Being inquisitive and unafraid to ask for help has helped to smoothen my transition to Junior College life.</p>

<p>Receiving the Yeong Wai Cheong Economics Award is a huge honour. I would like to express my gratitude to all my teachers who have made this possible and believed in me. I am privileged to be a member of this NJ community as everyone from teachers, friends, to non-teaching staff live together as one united family. We all know that Junior College life is stressful as we have many assignments to complete under tight deadlines. However,  I am really grateful to have amazing and encouraging teachers in NJC who will be the first one to lift us when we fall. One should never give up as our teachers will always be there for us to guide us and be the light in our darkness. I hope that everyone will try to reconnect with one another to maintain and to cherish the relationships that we share for a lifetime. Always remember to bring a smile to someone's face and see how beautiful your life will be! Service with honour!</p>

<p>My experience studying in National Junior College has been a phenomenal one that I would remember for the rest of my life: although my life in NJC has been extremely challenging, it has also been extremely rewarding and exciting. 

As a recipient of the Yeong Wai Cheong Economics Award, I am very grateful for this award as economics is a subject that I am very passionate about, and the monetary award and opportunities have helped me further my knowledge in this field.

Hockey was not the CCA I had intended to join initially, when I entered NJC. However, it has turned out to be the best choice of my time in NJC. I was given the opportunity to give back to my CCA by serving as Captain of Hockey, a role that has allowed me to gain many valuable skills and values through the many experiences I have had leading my team. Through Hockey, I have forged unforgettable memories and this CCA award is a recognition I will value for the rest of my life.

All in all, I greatly appreciate the awards given to me and I would like to thank my Teachers and NJC for giving me such an amazing JC experience.</p>

<p>As a recipient of the Yeong Wai Cheong Economics award, I feel proud to have been recognised for my hard work and dedication towards the subject. Economics has always been a subject close to my heart, and I have consistently put in effort to improve my understanding of it. 

I remembered failing my first Economics test as it was a very new subject and I was struggling to understand it. Of course, I felt disheartened and discouraged. But I am so grateful and appreciative to have my Economics teacher, Ms Foo, who was constantly there to give me her advice and encouragement and patiently clarified any doubts that I had. Eventually, I saw a huge improvement in my understanding of Economics. 

This award allows me to actually experience the slogan that ‘nothing is impossible’ and that we should always try to overcome any obstacles that we face, as each challenge is an opportunity for growth. The slogan ‘nothing is impossible’ thus serves as a reminder that motivates me to work even harder and constantly strive for the best knowing that my efforts will eventually bear fruit.

I am very blessed and honoured to be able to receive these two awards as they have provided me with opportunities and experiences that taught me to always take pride and put in all my heart to strive for the best in everything that I do. Thank you!</p>

<p>Six years in NJC have truly been an unforgettable and memorable journey. I am immensely grateful for the opportunities NJC has provided for me to learn, grow, and develop holistically, and not just in the academic domain. It was in NJC that I learned more about myself, honed my soft skills, and formed lasting memories. Nevertheless, I could not have achieved these without the support and guidance of wonderful teachers, family, and friends, who have been my strong pillars of support since day one. When faced with challenges, I feel that it is very important for us to believe in ourselves. Many of us tend to underestimate ourselves, but once we look past our fears and muster the courage to reimagine what we can be, we will be surprised at what we are truly capable of. This encapsulates the source of my motivation all these years. Just like how many people have gone out of their way to support me, I am inspired to also do the same. It is my goal to always reconnect with the values the college has instilled in me and to continue to strive to do my best and value-add to society.</p>

<p>I am truly honored to receive this award. This would not have been possible without the teachers and peers who have given me various opportunities to learn how to lead - and for that I am extremely grateful to them.

Many years later, I may not remember all the Chemistry concepts or Mathematical formulae that I have learnt in NJC. However, I am positive that I will remember the many important lessons on leadership I have learnt. As I watched my teachers and peers, I learnt the importance of leading by example, leading with empathy and leading harmoniously.

A senior once told me, “The more mistakes you make, the more you learn”. Don’t be afraid to take on bigger responsibilities, especially in your schooling life. There will be teachers to guide you and help you up when you fall. Try everything your heart tells you to and if you fail - it’s just	another interesting story to tell at a gathering.</p>

<p>Coming into NJC as a JAE student, time morphs into our worst enemy as we attempt to experience as much as we can before our ‘two-year pass’ expires. I am extremely honoured to have teachers and friends willing to walk down this path with me and to be in a school that has provided me a plethora of opportunities to fully utilise this ‘pass’. 

Through these experiences, I can confidently say that NJC has been a catalyst to my personal growth. I would otherwise not be the person I am today if I had not been posted to NJC. Receiving this award is a testament to my hard work over the past two years. I hope it serves as an inspiration for future batches to continue striving to be the best version of themselves. 

My advice to future batches would be this: even as you strive for excellence, always be kind and aim to make a positive impact on those whom you cross paths with. At the end of the day, it is not the accolades you receive, but your values that you will be remembered for.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I would ponder over what it meant to be a good leader. Seeing seniors lead with such charismatic ease, I wondered how they always knew what to do. Only when it was my turn to step up did I start developing some ideas from practical experience. Here is my personal leadership philosophy: at its core, leadership is about forming relationships with the people around you, understanding them, and working together with them towards a common goal. It has to be ground-up; only by understanding the needs and voices of the people around us can we truly pave a path for them. Leadership means having a desire to serve others; thus, any action undertaken in service of others is already “leading”.

I am grateful to the teachers, other remarkable student leaders, and everyone I have worked with, who have never ceased to inspire me. Leading and working alongside them has been a privilege. What I have learned from them is simple but valuable: leading is about having a vision and staying true to it; it is also about the process of working with others to bring this vision to life, for the people around you.

Be not afraid to reimagine the world, but instead work towards what is best for your community. That is what leadership is all about.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic struck, I was 13 and searching for a purpose in the things I do. It was not until the lockdown that I was forced to slow down and introspect, to rediscover my passions and, most importantly, reconnect with myself. This break helped me realise my love for the sciences and teaching, which has forged my self-identity.

Now aged 17, I find my call for a purpose answered through my endeavours in science research and community tutoring. These experiences have helped me reconnect with more than just myself – it has reconnected me with the larger community by establishing meaningful relationships for me to grow holistically as we emerge from a pandemic. 

As a reconnected college, we can renew our participation in various opportunities to give back to our communities and bring to life the dream campus we collectively reimagine.</p>

						<summary>Read the members' reflections</summary>
<p>Project Artemis aims to spread awareness on the importance of wildlife conservation in Singapore by reimagining education on wildlife through collaboration with various social service organisations.The project team had the opportunity to work alongside at-risk primary school students. Most of the core members are from Greenlink, the environmental club in NJC, and have a collective interest in wildlife conservation. 

After months of project planning and liaising with the various stakeholders, the team held a series of workshops for different childcare centres where students were engaged through various hands-on activities. Project Artemis reached out to more than 200 primary school students, offering them opportunities to learn more about wildlife through engaging and interactive activities and applying this knowledge learnt into their daily lives. 

Additionally, Project Artemis offers an avenue for young students to find new ways to make meaningful use of their time, enabling them to grow as individuals and take action to support future conservation efforts. It is now helmed by Greenlink, who will be liaising with the childcare centres to plan out future sessions, ensuring the sustainability of the project and its continued impact on primary school children.</p>

           <summary>“He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.”</summary>
<p>If this quote from missionary Jim Elliot drives and directs my spiritual life as a Christian, then hopefully it is something that has reflected my teaching and service to NJC for the past 15 years. What can I not keep that I have given to my students? The shared knowledge and experiences I have gained both as a former student myself, and now in my role as a teacher. Not that I cannot keep it all to myself, but what would it profit me?
	
What do I gain from sharing all my knowledge and experiences? Hopefully the students’ learning, and moments and memories that they keep with them through their lives and in time to come, also share and impart them to others. Until the day this no longer applies, each life touched is a life touched for the rest of the student’s life.</p>

           <summary>I’m still in my teenage years of teaching, and many more years of learning to come. May my students and athletes feel the same about what comes ahead of them - so much more to learn and so much more to grow!</summary>
<p>I didn’t think I would stay in teaching for 15 years, let alone 15 years in NJC. Every single interaction that I have with my students is a reminder of the privilege I get to interact and have the opportunity to leave an imprint in their lives, regardless of the time spent. I hope that with the time I have spent in NJC is in part, contributing to a culture and a history that builds a sense of belonging for the students who have long graduated, especially those from the Track &amp; Field team. The common experiences they have shared, passed through the years, because of the family they see themselves a part of. 15 years is not a long time - that’s just the life span of a teenager just starting to take flight. I’m still in my teenage years of teaching, and many more years of learning to come. May my students and athletes feel the same about what comes ahead of them - so much more to learn and so much more to grow!</p>

<p><q>To teach is to touch the lives of many<br>
And to help us learn Life's lessons.<br>
But to teach well is to make a difference<br>
In all the lives you touch.

To teach is to be tender, loving,<br>
strong and giving to all who rely upon you;<br>
To encourage and praise.<br>
But to teach well is to believe in what and whom you teach.<br>
~ Jann Matthew Papin</q>
	
Even after 15 years in this teaching journey, I am still striving to be able to teach well. The teaching journey, as expected of all journeys in life, is not a straight line forward but is full of ups and downs and sometimes necessary diversions and u-turns. But I am heartened, in this journey, to have the company of my students as well as my fellow colleagues, as we strive to make the difference in the world and community we live in.</p>

    <summary>What continues to excite me about teaching is that every day presents a brand new opportunity to learn more about my students, understand them better and help them find meaning in learning.</summary>
<p>It has been a wonderful 15 years of teaching at National Junior College. I am thankful for the memories and friendship forged with like-minded colleagues and students. As much as I try to make a positive influence on my students’ lives and to help them reach their potential, my students have also taught me so much and added value in my life. What continues to excite me about teaching is that every day presents a brand new opportunity to learn more about my students, understand them better and help them find meaning in learning.</p>

    <summary>I hope that my students place more faith in their passions, and recognise that passion does not have to be associated with impracticality and naivety. Instead of seeking security in conventional paths, may they dare to venture in storms, because they will be brilliant sailors charting their own courses.</summary>
		<p>I like to think that my work is meaningful: when I teach my students about tentative language, my hope is for them to be open-minded in receiving and weighing perspectives. When I dissuade them from using absolute words, my hope for them is to avoid polarised, bigoted thinking. When we interpret symbols and metaphors, we’re learning that instead of confining and restricting, language flourishes in possibilities – language conveys profound truths in indirect and slanted ways. When we analyse characters, we also learn something about ourselves and find reason to forge on. I hope that my students place more faith in their passions, and recognise that passion does not have to be associated with impracticality and naivety. Instead of seeking security in conventional paths, may they dare to venture in storms, because they will be brilliant sailors charting their own courses.</p>

<p>I have always been part of the NJC Boarding Office Team since joining National Junior College. I am deeply appreciative of the companionship and help that my teammates have provided me.

I am grateful for the opportunity to support the various boarding programmes involving the students of the College throughout the years. This is where my motivation lies: it is a great privilege for us to be able to witness the enduring bonds that students forge with each other in unique boarding programmes of the College.

I hope the students will always have their friends that they gained during their NJC days and are cognizant that friendship, kindness, and gentleness will always keep and rejuvenate us.</p>

		<p>Every moment of serving in NJC helps me to become more experienced and mature. I like the teaching process which helps enable and prepare the children to take on their own life challenges with excitement, adventure and uncertainty. 

I hope that all NJCians can be open to life and regret nothing at the end of the day; use the 2-6 years here to acquire sufficient skills in managing themselves not just academically but also emotionally beyond the campus life. Learning to embrace their own strengths, weaknesses and appreciating each other’s differences is important for finding their inner joy and satisfaction in life.</p>

		<p>The last 10 years that I have spent in NJC has been a privilege. This memorable decade enabled me to grow personally and professionally, and all this is made possible with the generous support and guidance I have received through working with collaborative colleagues. The collective energy that our fraternity gives to all our NJCians fuel my passion and commitment to the work I do daily. The concept of time is very real in the study of History. I would like to part with this quote, "Do something NOW for which your FUTURE self with thank you later." The present will pass, but always do things with purpose and impact, and be grateful for the past, present and future. Thank you, NJC, for making my years here fulfilling and enriching.</p>

		<p>NJC is arguably a microcosm of Singapore, as some like to describe it. Teaching at NJC has been a humbling experience, as the opportunity to work with students from different backgrounds over the years has allowed me to live vicariously and uncover more about myself as a person. Hopefully, this valuable opportunity of experiencing diversity extends to our students as well. May it plant tiny seeds in our students, and flower somewhere down the road, providing some respite as they find their place in the world.</p>

		<p>I can hardly believe that it has been a decade. NJC has been my first school since I joined the service and I have learnt a lot about myself in my years here. I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to serve in various capacities and projects, some really memorable ones include the NJ50 Musical, Sports on Board &amp; the Boarding School Programme.
			
Teaching is never easy. There have been times when I have faced challenges but the safe environment my colleagues provided with has helped me immensely. Also, the students are lovely and kind towards each other and their teachers, making teaching an incredibly rewarding experience.

I hope that NJCians will grow to become compassionate people who use their gifts to make the world a better place. Most importantly, I wish for them to be fearless in their pursuit of their passions and never let failure stop them. They all deserve to lead meaningful lives that bring joy to themselves and others.</p>

		<p>When I first came to NJC, I was impressed with and enriched by the strong culture and support for teachers’ professional development school-wide and the collaborative learning in the department through the fortnightly Buzz and PP sessions to enrich our PD experiences. 
  
I wish to teach our NJC students to develop a sense of curiosity about the world around us and how it operates; to be able to think critically why things work the way they do; to have the passion to explore and gain new experiences and know that what they do can have a significant impact on the world around us; to possess the open-mindedness and the willingness to consider different perspectives and viewpoints. By fostering these qualities and skills, I believe they will be well-equipped to make meaningful contributions in their fields.

		<p>It was surreal when I first stepped into NJC as a teacher; it felt like not too long ago when I was here as a student. It is my genuine hope that every NJC-ian who passes through these hallowed halls (or rather, the hallowed long corridor from the bus stop to the school building - great way to keep fit!) finds their place in life and society, and contributes actively to their community in various ways. I also wish for the students here that no matter how much time passes or how many fantastic places in the world you travel to, you will always be able to come back to NJC or to your NJC people, and think to yourself that ah, this feels like home.</p>

		<p>The past ten years in NJC have been a humbling and fruitful experience. What I love best about teaching is the fact that I am constantly growing alongside my students and colleagues in the Language Arts department and the Symphonic Band team. I enjoy the variety of experiences I get to have at work in a supportive environment, and I always appreciate building off the energy, curiosity and initiative of fellow learners. Nothing is ever static, and each year we discover and develop new and refreshing means of opening up our students' horizons. 

My hope for NJC students is that they find pride and meaning in everything they do, and that they bring a love of words and ideas into their future endeavours.</p>

		<p>I didn’t realise that 10 years have gone past just like that! Many people (colleagues, students etc.) have walked with me on this journey and I am grateful to be part of their journeys too. I am happy to be given opportunities to teach various subjects (H1, H2, H3 Chemistry and Project Work) and be part of different departments.

What motivates me to keep going is when I see people growing. Not in the physical sense, but you can see students becoming better and that shows in the way they articulate themselves and behave.

I hope that our NJC students find relevance in what they are learning to their future university courses, careers or any aspect of their lives. Live life to the fullest.</p>

		<p>10 years sounds like such a long time but honestly, the time just flew by. As an alumna, I feel proud to have the opportunity to serve in NJC and contribute back to the community here. I am grateful for the chance to work alongside dedicated and passionate colleagues from whom I have had the privilege of learning much from, and also the wonderful students who have taught me many things as well.

		<p>Seeing my students learn, grow, and succeed can be incredibly rewarding and can provide a strong sense of purpose and fulfillment in my work. Knowing that they are making a positive impact on the lives of others can be a powerful motivator for many teachers to continue teaching. 

I hope that our students can demonstrate resilience in the face of challenges and setbacks with a growth mindset, which involves embracing challenges and seeing them as opportunities for learning and growth.
