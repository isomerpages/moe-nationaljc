        <p> Mr. Ang Pow Chew <br>
<img src="/images/ecol2.png" style="width:283px;height:340px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> 2020 marks the start of our College’s 51st year. This is also a year of an unprecedented disruption of school and schooling which we were accustomed to. All stakeholders of our school community have had to adjust to an online mode of teaching and learning enacted outside of the school building. I am glad our teachers and students have been able to exercise mental and behavioural flexibility to adjust quickly to a changed environment.

Despite the change thrusted upon us, we must remain steadfast, to provide our students an education that helps them to seek to know how to think, not just what to think. We must continue to focus on educating the heart and the mind, and endeavour to instil in our students the CARE values and principles that our school has promulgated. We must pride ourselves to help our students grow and develop into adults with a deep sense of service to the community.

As we complete 50 years of service and embark on our 51st year, we should take heed that success comes to those who work hard and stays with those who don’t rest on the achievements of the past. We must continue to strive and to serve with honour.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank our stakeholders. We are fortunate to have a supportive and committed School Advisory Committee, dedicated teachers, concerned and co- operative parents.

Service with Honour. <br>

      <p>We would like to take this opportunity to sincerely congratulate our teachers, who have dedicated 25, 15 and 10 years to the education service respectively. <br> <br>

Click on the name of the teacher awardee to read his/her heartfelt thoughts. <br>Long Service Award: 25 Years <br> <br> <img src="/images/ecol5.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “As a teacher, I hope that ultimately my students are able to persevere throughout any trials in life and are able to find something that stirs their passion and gives them happiness. I hope that they will not be afraid of mistakes but rather have the courage to try once more. I want them to be able to not only take away subject knowledge but also values and morals from their journey in NJC.” <br> <br>
				Long Service Award: 15 Years <br>
				<img src="/images/ecol6.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “Respect the knowledge and where it comes from; from authentic sources, my teachers and even if it comes from my own students … that’s where I believe true wisdom is attained. Appreciate it and it will naturally be retained and glow in us.” <br>
					<img src="/images/ecol7.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “I just want my students to achieve ABC in life – A for Accolade, B for Betterment, C for Compassion. Always strive to be your best, better than yesterday, and be good to all beings in this world.” <br> <img src="/images/ecol8.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “I want students to enjoy learning and take pride in their work. I want students to be a positive force and recognise that everyone of us has different strengths to contribute to the place we live in.” <br>
				<img src="/images/ecol9.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “I would like students to be able to see relevance in what they have learnt and apply it to their careers or everyday life. They need not necessarily become doctors or scientists, but at the end of the day I hope that they are competent and able to analyse issues and think critically, such that their opinions about certain issues related to Science emerge.” <br>
	<img src="/images/ecol10.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">	“To my students I’d like to say, always do your best, because you deserve nothing better than the best.” <br>
