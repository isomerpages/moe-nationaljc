        <p> Mr. Ang Pow Chew <br>
<img src="/images/ecol2.png" style="width:283px;height:340px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> 2020 marks the start of our College’s 51st year. This is also a year of an unprecedented disruption of school and schooling which we were accustomed to. All stakeholders of our school community have had to adjust to an online mode of teaching and learning enacted outside of the school building. I am glad our teachers and students have been able to exercise mental and behavioural flexibility to adjust quickly to a changed environment.

Despite the change thrusted upon us, we must remain steadfast, to provide our students an education that helps them to seek to know how to think, not just what to think. We must continue to focus on educating the heart and the mind, and endeavour to instil in our students the CARE values and principles that our school has promulgated. We must pride ourselves to help our students grow and develop into adults with a deep sense of service to the community.

As we complete 50 years of service and embark on our 51st year, we should take heed that success comes to those who work hard and stays with those who don’t rest on the achievements of the past. We must continue to strive and to serve with honour.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank our stakeholders. We are fortunate to have a supportive and committed School Advisory Committee, dedicated teachers, concerned and co- operative parents.

Service with Honour. <br>

    <label for="accordion4">A Journey in Education and Service</label>

    <div>

      <p>We would like to take this opportunity to sincerely congratulate our teachers, who have dedicated 25, 15 and 10 years to the education service respectively. <br> <br>

Click on the name of the teacher awardee to read his/her heartfelt thoughts. <br>Long Service Award: 25 Years <br> <br> <img src="/images/ecol5.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “As a teacher, I hope that ultimately my students are able to persevere throughout any trials in life and are able to find something that stirs their passion and gives them happiness. I hope that they will not be afraid of mistakes but rather have the courage to try once more. I want them to be able to not only take away subject knowledge but also values and morals from their journey in NJC.” <br> <br>
				Long Service Award: 15 Years <br>
				<img src="/images/ecol6.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “Respect the knowledge and where it comes from; from authentic sources, my teachers and even if it comes from my own students … that’s where I believe true wisdom is attained. Appreciate it and it will naturally be retained and glow in us.” <br> <br><br><br><br>
					<img src="/images/ecol7.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “I just want my students to achieve ABC in life – A for Accolade, B for Betterment, C for Compassion. Always strive to be your best, better than yesterday, and be good to all beings in this world.” <br><br><br><br><br> <img src="/images/ecol8.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “I want students to enjoy learning and take pride in their work. I want students to be a positive force and recognise that everyone of us has different strengths to contribute to the place we live in.” <br><br><br> <br><br>
				<img src="/images/ecol9.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “I would like students to be able to see relevance in what they have learnt and apply it to their careers or everyday life. They need not necessarily become doctors or scientists, but at the end of the day I hope that they are competent and able to analyse issues and think critically, such that their opinions about certain issues related to Science emerge.” <br><br>
	<img src="/images/ecol10.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">	“To my students I’d like to say, always do your best, because you deserve nothing better than the best.” <br><br><br><br><br> <br>
<img src="/images/ecol11.png" style="width:170px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">	“As an educator, I would like my students to find meaning in what they do and discover their passion in life. I would also want them to develop empathy and learn to uplift others as they grow up to become good citizens and leaders with sound values. I believe that these traits are important to guide them through the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world in this 21st century.” <br> <br>
				<img src="/images/ecol12.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “The world is no longer what it is and you will be living and leading in a world, rich in uncertainty where the old ways of doing things no longer work. You have to really stop just thinking about yourselves but about each other. There is a difference between pleasure (playing video games, handphone usage etc) and joy (finding pursuits where you add value to others’ lives). Over time, I hope that you will reduce activities that give you pleasure.“ <br> 
				<img src="/images/ecol13.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “The most satisfying moment for any teacher is when his student, after years, remembers him and quotes a few small incidents that touched the student’s life. What looks small to me would have made all the difference in the student’s life and the feeling is just awesome. No amount of money can give you the satisfaction that I get watching my students grow.” <br><br>
				<img src="/images/ecol14.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “I am motivated when I see the smiles that appear on the students’ face or the “Eureka” moment in their eyes when they have grasped a difficult concept or topic. Everyone learns differently and one of the high points in the teaching journey is to have the opportunity to be creative, think of various activities to make learning fun and scientific concepts easy to understand such that students can learn effectively. There is nothing more rewarding than knowing that you can make an impact on students’ life with the chance to better each student, both academically and also as a person.” <br> <br>
				Long Service Award: 10 Years <br> <br> <img src="/images/ecol15.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “每年我都会问学生“为什么你们要学华文？”这个问题，很多学生的回答是“因为我是华人，我要了解自己的文化，否则别人会看不起我的。“这些回答让我感动，同时也让我明白，作为华文老师除了让学生学华文，更应该让他们明白这个语言的优美、丰富，让他们有机会掌握丰富的文化，让他们的未来因为我懂华文而自豪和骄傲.“ <br> <br> <br>
				<img src="/images/ecol16.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “Every student has different goals and aims in life. As a teacher, there is no one fixed common goal that I want all of them to achieve, other than that they grow up to become people with the right character values, who will use what they have learnt to help improve society and those who can benefit from their contributions.” <br> <br>
				<img src="/images/ecol17.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “As they grow up and mature, I hope that all students will find a sense of purpose in what they choose to do because that will ground them and give them something to work hard for. As much as having dreams is important, they should also commit to putting in the hard work necessary for producing the results that they want to achieve. Above all, they should commit to being good people who care for others and help to build each other up.” <br> 
				<img src="/images/ecol18.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “What I want most for my students is that they learn to appreciate, especially to appreciate what they have.” <br><br><br><br><br> <br>
				<img src="/images/ecol19.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “As an academic teacher, I hope for students to excel academically. However, it is more important for them to be developed into concerned citizens, where they make decisions by considering not only themselves but also others; are unafraid to stand up for what is right; contribute to the community and shape the future of our nation.” <br> <br><br>
<img src="/images/ecol20.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “I would like my students to enjoy the different aspects of physics that they have encountered, within and outside class. Sure, it’s Physics. They may feel frustrated and challenged sometimes, but that’s all good. Why? Because they are learning.” <br><br><br><br><br>
				<img src="/images/ecol21.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “As individuals, each student will have his or her own goal and aspiration. I hope that as they fulfill their dreams in life, they will also be able to think critically, be socially aware, and be able to find their sense of purpose in life and society.” <br> <br><br><br><br>
				<img src="/images/ecol22.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “My hope for my students is that they take courage to make mistakes but learn from them to stand up and try again. One day when they look back, they would see how that tenacity has built their character and optimism for life.” <br> <br><br><br><br>
				<img src="/images/ecol23.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “更能触动心弦的是一考完试后，学生就立刻发过来的短讯—其中的内容，表达了对老师的感激，甚至觉得自己表现不理想，达不到老师的要求，对不起老师，深感内疚。学生毕业回校探望老师，来到面前告诉你：“老师，我喜欢你的华文课！谢谢你教我华文。”这话会让我睡得很香很甜! 能教出懂得感恩的学生还有什么遗憾呢?” <br> <br><br>
				<img src="/images/ecol24.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> “I remain hopeful that my students have the ability to attain their personal goals, lead a life that they desire in the future, and demonstrate the College’s Values in whatever they choose to undertake. Be daring to make a difference!” <br><br> <br><br>
We also want to express our gratitude to our Technical Support and Operations Support Officers, and our Allied Educator, for dedicating 10 years of valuable service to NJC. <br><br>
