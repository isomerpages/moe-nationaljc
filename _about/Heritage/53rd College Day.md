The last 2 years have been marked by a “Covid crisis” which tested the resolve and resilience in all of us. As we now begin to emerge from the other side of this crisis, I want to acknowledge the courage and resilience that all members of the NJC community have demonstrated. <br><br>

I am proud of my colleagues for their compassion that they have demonstrated for all NJCians as we navigated the 2 challenging years. My colleagues, with their resourcefulness, have adapted and have gone the extra mile to maximise learning opportunities for NJCians. <br><br>

I am proud of NJCians for their readiness to adjust and adapt. NJCians are respectful, hardworking, and always encouraging. I am confident that they will continue to go much further and become who each of them hopes to be. <br><br>

I am proud of the parents of NJCians. They have been supportive and appreciative of our efforts to help their children learn and grow. <br><br>

I am proud of our School Advisory Committee (SAC) and NJC Alumni for their encouragement and support. We have been able to fund many programmes and provide financial assistance for NJCians through their generosity. <br><br>

Together, we are a community and we wield together the strength in our hearts to ride any crisis. Most importantly, we have grown together during the most testing of times. <br><Br>

He is a social entrepreneur who advocates co-creating social businesses, re-designing meaningful careers to solve social problems, and to narrow the divide between the haves and have-nots by adding value to the lives of others. <br><br> In one of Mr Yong’s trips to Thailand in 2009, he launched Tigerland Rice Farm with the local hill tribes to provide the first-of-its-kind back-to-nature fun-experiential rice-farming eco-vacations, and supported the hill tribes to create self-help enterprises. More social projects were rolled out in subsequent years to reach out to the poor and disadvantaged in India and Kenya too. <br><br> Two of our students, Edward Thomas Patani and Nadia Azuhar, interviewed Mr Yong to find out more about his experiences. <br><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fzZoJDTI8E">Click here</a> to view Mr Yong’s Address on NJC’s Youtube Channel. </p>

<label for="accordion2">Adding Value to the Lives of Others </label>

    <div>

<p> In NJC, our understanding of what Service with Honour means has, in recent years, been refreshed with the tagline of “_adding value to the lives of others”_. This interpretation has given staff and students a clear view of actions that they can take in order to realise the College motto in our everyday lives, within the College and in the wider community. <br><br> <img src="/images/col3.png" style="width:80%"> <Br> Staff and students believe that their desire to add value to the lives of others must start on homeground. This is seen in senior staff mentoring junior staff since the guiding belief is that “every child wants to and can learn”, and the continual professional growth of our teachers is key to the quality of student learning. The mentor’s role, previously seen as a coach or an imparter of wisdom, has evolved to become one that involves collaborative learning in a collegial relationship. The mentors in the NJC fraternity work with mentees to build a learning culture where teachers are given space and time, and various platforms and opportunities, to have professional conversations on teaching and learning challenges and best practices. Undeterred by the challenges to be overcome during the last year, as face-to-face meetings continued to be replaced by virtual meetings, lesson observations reduced in frequency, teachers found their own ways to navigate around these challenges. Thus,  we continued to work towards improving our teaching practices, oftentimes by connecting with fellow teachers within and across disciplines. In so doing, we continued to add value to each other’s work, build our teaching community’s capacity to better serve the learning needs of our students. <br><img src="/images/col4.png" style="width:80%">  <br> Students are also playing their part, demonstrating that their actions can improve the quality of school experience for others in the College community. From Student Council to Class Committees, student leaders in particular, have been exercising their roles in commendable ways. In particular, Peer Support Leaders, being involved in organising  class and school-wide events like peer bonding activities, Healthy Lifestyle Month and Teachers’ Day Programme, are best positioned to provide some of the needed social and emotional support to their juniors in lower JH, or to their peers experiencing difficulties or distress. As the PSLs are identified from within classes, they are generally aware of classroom situations and their effects on peers. Not only are they helping selected students with academic challenges, they are well-placed to alert teachers and school counsellors when circumstances call for support in the social-emotional areas. This area of service by students for their peers was especially important and helpful as Singapore and NJC worked through the Covid -19 experience. <br><img src="/images/col5.png" style="width:80%">  <br>Beyond NJC, students were engaged in service to their community in various efforts, despite and indeed, because of the challenges of these Covid-19 times. CCAs did their part where possible, to add to the learning of others. One example was Greenlink Club who took the opportunity offered by the virtual Green Symposium, to invite participating schools to start their own vermicompost projects, offering online support after dispatching the worm farm kits. One year later, with the easing of Covid restrictions, at least one school is seeking advice in their next phase to scale up their vermicomposting project and involve more members of their school community. <br><img src="/images/col6.png" style="width:80%">  <br>Other student segments were also involved in giving back to the society. One example is the one-day JH2 Intergenerational Learning Programme in 2021 where different classes engaged senior beneficiaries over zoom platforms in various workshops – to help them be part of the green movement as well as bridge the digital divide that was seen to have excluded seniors from participating in much of social life during the Covid years. These workshops, designed and prepared by classes over four months, included sessions teaching seniors to make wallets from recycled materials or fertilizers from home-based materials, as well as workshops introducing them to Telegram, the sticker-culture and basic video-making applications. These projects offered a chance for students to add value to the lives of others by initiating their entry into virtual communities, and an avenue to grow in empathy and team work skills themselves, as they learnt to work together.<br><img src="/images/col7.png" style="width:80%">  <br>The NJC community saw an opportunity to fulfill dual aims in the Meal Support Programme.   Conceived in response to the economic devastation resulting from the pandemic Circuit Breaker, the Programme served to support both the NJC canteen vendors whose businesses were significantly affected by a few months of national measures to slow down the virus spread within schools, as well as many others in the community who had been affected by job losses. The Meal Support Programme provided an avenue for teachers, students and parents in the NJC community to work together to contribute towards a college-wide effort to move resources and benefit multiple communities. Donations enabled canteen vendors to continue operating their businesses, providing meals for the members of public in need, with voluntary meal delivery service support from parents, teachers and students. The coming together of the different segments of the NJC community at such a time demonstrated clearly the values of our College.</p>
