</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>This theme highlights the interplay between the builders – the individuals
who contribute through their effort, vision, and dedication to shaping
a brighter future for all, and the bricks – the steadfast value of integrity
that forms the foundation of lasting success. Loyalty reflects the builders’
commitment to the shared purpose, and integrity embodies the strength and
reliability of the actions and principles that hold everything together.
Just as a well-built structure stands firm through the synergy of both,
our College thrives when these virtues are upheld. Hence, at this College
Day, we honour those who have upheld these values by leading with moral
courage, uplifting others, and striving for excellence.</p>

<summary><strong>Message from our Principal</strong>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><strong>Mrs Lucy Toh</strong>

</div>
<p>In our 56th year and in my 3rd year as Principal, I have been reflecting
on NJC’s four-fold Vision Statement which was developed by the College
community almost twenty years ago. On College Day, we give thanks for and
recognise members of the NJC community who exemplify Leadership with Sensitivity,
Scholarship with Creativity, Loyalty with Integrity and, above all, Service
with Honour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are two schools of thought about Vision and Mission statements.
Some feel that these should be evergreen – describing the unchanging values
and purpose of an organisation. Others take the view that the Vision should
be a picture of a reality that we must achieve in a defined period of time.
I think there is wisdom and truth in both these views.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So how about NJC? It is my view that there are and have always been members
of the College community who exemplify our four-fold Vision Statement.
What we do not yet see, however, is that these powerful statements can
characterise all of us – staff, students and alumni – all the time. Imagine
the impact of NJC on Singapore and the world if this truth was kept within
our line of sight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year, we are focusing on Loyalty with Integrity. The theme of College
Day: Loyalty in the Builders, Integrity in the Bricks draws from the metaphor
of the activity of constructing a building. As it happens, the College
has just undergone its cyclical General Repair and Renovation (GR&amp;R)
which MOE undertakes for all schools on a roughly five-year basis. Ours
was a little delayed due to the Covid-19 Pandemic.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The College GR&amp;R may seem mundane but upon reflection there is much
that we can learn from it. It is so easy for us to take for granted our
buildings and facilities. In a tropical climate, if we do not maintain
them, they will deteriorate to the point of being unusable in no time.
I am grateful that, thanks to prudent stewardship of government revenues,
the MOE gets the budget to spend every year on the cyclical maintenance
of all of Singapore’s school buildings. No one gets left out. Every school
is kept in good condition so that learning can take place. Invisible perhaps,
but non-trivial.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On a more sober note, let us remember that the constant battle against
entropy and decay is true not just for buildings but for us all. Individually,
our lives move from birth inexorably on to death. Nations rise and fall.
Some may say, why bother to try to improve things if the world is dark
and getting darker? I remember asking my father this very question when
I was a JC student. His reply was, “It’s true that the world grows darker.
I choose to push back the darkness.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are very specific things that we can do that will outlast us if
we choose to do them. As loyal builders – loyal to our fellow human beings
– and as bricks with integrity – a small part of the structure contributing
strength to the whole – let us make those choices today.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I commend to you here a short description of how Loyalty with Integrity
might be manifest for each of us in our daily lives, especially, in the
various groups we belong to – from our CCA groups to our various chat groups!
And from this ‘group’ called NJC to the larger groups of our nation and
our world!</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Loyalty</em></strong><em> means that I will:&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Ask not what my group can do for me,&nbsp;but what I can do for them</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>Integrity</em></strong><em> means that I will:</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Uphold moral standards and sportsmanship</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Celebrate the success and victories of others</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Do what is right even when no one is watching</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Service with Honour!</p>

<h4>Student Awards</h4>

</div>
<p>My six years in NJC are marked by deep gratitude for the faculty, facilities,
and friends who have shaped my journey. The College’s culture of care has
nurtured me holistically and inspired me to give back through service.
Through this, I’ve realised that we are all on the same team, fighting
the same battles, where everyone has a place to serve with honour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, we each find gratitude in our own way. For my foodie friends,
it’s the basil pork with extra scoops of chilli at the canteen. For the
science-y ones, it’s the thrill of using the NMR machine in the Sigma Lab.
But no matter what draws us in, we build love for the community in our
own ways, lay our own bricks, and make our own difference.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’m deeply honoured to receive the Student of the Year Award, a recognition
I owe to the passionate teachers and friends who have supported me, brick
by brick.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moving forward, I hope we can find inspiration in the foundation laid
by the lineage of builders before us, and choose to serve with love and
honour, letting our NJ tower stand one brick taller.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>The Lim Kim Woon Award</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Lim Kim Woon Award, initiated and structured by a former NJCian in

<p><strong>ANGELENE KHO KAR YI</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/College Day 2025/ANGELENE_KHO_KAR_YI.jpg">
</div>
<p>I am truly honoured to be receiving the Lim Kim Woon Award, and would
like to thank my teachers, friends, and family who have stood by me and
supported me throughout my journey in NJC.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Service with Honour” is especially meaningful to me because I want to
reach out to those who may not be as privileged as I am. Service, to me,
is about recognising that everyone’s situation is different, and asking
how I can use my strengths and resources to help in whatever way I can.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In NJC, I have been blessed with many opportunities to take part in community
service projects, and I believe this ignited the passion in me to continue
serving. Through these experiences, I’ve learnt that service is not a one-time
event, but a mindset we carry into every interaction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Receiving this award motivates me to continue serving with compassion
and integrity and, more importantly, to inspire others to do the same.
I hope that through my actions, more people will be encouraged to lead
with kindness, serve with honour, and make a difference in the lives of
those around them, no matter how small.</p>

</div>
<p>Reflecting on my journey in NJC, a word I believe encapsulates my experience
as an NJCian is kindness - specifically, the many acts of kindness I was
fortunate enough to witness and receive over the past six years, which
broadened my understanding of what it means to serve with honour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whether it was the unwavering support and guidance of teachers who dedicated
themselves to our growth as individuals, or the compassion of peers, seniors,
and alumni who addressed my many questions and alleviated my concerns,
these interactions inspired me to give back, and fostered a firm belief
that no act of kindness is ever too small.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If my time at NJC has taught me anything, it’s that everyone has the potential
to make a positive impact on another’s life. Whether we choose to lead,
volunteer, or uplift those around us, the support we offer can comfort,
the values we embody can inspire, and the dedication we bring to our projects
can make their impact ever more profound.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am deeply honoured to receive the Lim Kim Woon Award, and am immensely
grateful for the unyielding support of my friends and teachers who have
encouraged and inspired me along the way.</p>

</div>
<p>Receiving this award is both fulfilling and, admittedly, a bit of a surprise
to me. When I first encountered English-dependent subjects like History
and Literature, they felt almost too foreign and intimidating - full of
dates, metaphors, and complex theories. I remember thinking, What have
I gotten myself into? I even began to question my choice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But, as with all good stories, there were guides along the way - teachers
and staff in NJC. They patiently explained, reassured, and never let me
feel like I wasn't capable. Their belief in me was the scaffolding that
helped me climb from confusion to clarity. Meanwhile, I spent countless
hours devouring books, notes, and online resources like the Internet Archive.
Slowly, the subjects transformed from obstacles into pure passions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A testament to the NJC staff who laid the foundation, and to the integrity
of hard work and persistence that made me who I am, this award is as much
theirs as it is mine. Indeed, a teacher's tale dwells in every student:
for in the grand structure of dreams, there is loyalty in the builders,
and integrity in the bricks.</p>

</div>
<p>In my time studying the humanities, the values of loyalty and integrity
were key in discussions, essays, and reflections. Staying true to one’s
beliefs while making the effort to understand alternate perspectives was
what allowed my peers and me to engage in rich debates, mutually building
up our knowledge and growing alongside each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being a humanities student was a challenging yet rewarding journey, as
my understanding of the world around me was constantly taken apart and
reformed. Coming to terms with diverse perspectives and conflicting ideas
honed my analytical skills, pushing me to reflect more deeply. Through
my exploration of the human experience and the global political and economic
landscape, I have been well equipped to understand the changing world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am truly grateful to the teachers who took the time to understand each
one of us, challenging our thinking and believing in us throughout. Their
passion and love for their subjects made my lessons with them thoroughly
memorable, with many of their humorous anecdotes from class still fresh
in my mind. The encouragement and support they provided have greatly deepened
my enjoyment of the humanities, and I would definitely recommend giving
the humanities a try.</p>

</div>
<p>Receiving the SAC Science Excellence Award is both a humbling and affirming
moment to cap off my NJC journey. From trying to find my bearings in the
SPIRE programme as a wide-eyed student in Junior High to becoming a confident
scientific communicator through the NUS-A*STAR-NJC Research Programme,
my scientific journey has been paved by numerous trailblazers before me:
teachers who dedicated countless hours drawing up lesson plans, liaising
with external partners, and patiently mentoring me; seniors who generously
gave their time to tutor, guide, and collate learning materials; and administrative
staff who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure the smooth operation
of school programmes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To me, this award is the product of their support and steadfast loyalty,
from which I have benefited immensely. Alongside that loyalty, I have found
personal integrity to be a key determinant in this achievement. Through
my research experience, I learnt to stay true to my moral pillars, whether
it was reporting unfavourable results or acknowledging uncertainties.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond the individual, I have come to recognise that personal integrity
is also integral to the collective strength of the student body - laying,
brick by brick, the foundations of a robust support network for batches
of NJCians to come.</p>

</div>
<p>I am truly honoured to receive this SAC sports excellence award. Receiving
this award really makes me feel like all my hard work paid off and motivates
me to work even harder to become better in my sport and as a person as
well. I really do believe that sports isn’t just about winning, but it’s
about building a good character. Be it perseverance, kindness or integrity,
the values that you can learn are endless! Personally, I feel that I've
become more resilient through my sports, and I've learnt to not give up
the moment I encounter problems, or stop trying when I know I can't do
it. It has truly taught me to do my very best in every circumstance and
no matter what the result is, it’s okay because I know I gave it my all!
So, I just want to encourage anyone who reads this to keep on trying! And
ultimately, it’s not about the results or medals you win, but the values
you’ve learnt that stick with you for the rest of your life.</p>

</div>
<p>My journey in NJC has been shaped by the people who stood by me, especially
when I felt like giving up. One moment I’ll never forget was in Secondary
2, during the 400m finals. Having fallen just before the finish line, it
felt like everything I had worked for slipped away in that instant. But
my teachers and coaches never let that moment define me. Their belief taught
me that failure isn’t the end, and gave me the strength to pick myself
up — both on and off the track. That experience showed me the meaning of
“Loyalty in the Builders, Integrity in the Bricks.” Loyalty is about people
standing by you at your lowest, and integrity is about staying true to
your values, even when no one’s watching. Receiving this award reminds
me of how much I’ve grown, and how much I owe to the community that believed
in me through every high and low. I’ll be proud to carry these lessons
with me, long after I leave NJC.</p>

<p>Before coming to NJ, I would have never imagined myself winning a sports
award. I had thought that student athletes were hardcore and dedicated
but also wasting their time on an activity they might not even be doing
a few years down the road — until I became one myself. Canoeing has really
taught me what being an athlete is — not just as a racer but as a person.
Together in the gruelling training sessions, we were disciplined, racing
in different competitions. I would be lying if I said I had never thought
of just quitting this sport because of the sheer amount of mental pressure
it gave me. However, I chose to stay and keep pushing on because of my
seniors who had chosen to stay for the team. “I feel like my work here
isn’t done” was their reply to my question on why they stayed in this CCA.
It has inspired me to keep pushing on, not just in the sport but for the
team as well, coming together to build a community and as a team to lift
one another up. Thank you to my coaches, teachers and teammates for the
heart and effort you have put into this CCA.</p>

<p>Receiving this award feels like a moment where all the pieces of my academic
and co-curricular journeys in the arts and humanities align gracefully.
My role as Vice President of the Editorial Club, and the countless hours
spent preparing for writing and recital competitions - these experiences
have been my canvas, painted with perseverance and avid enthusiasm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I owe this recognition to my teachers, who’ve been loyal builders, laying
down the foundation of wisdom with unwavering commitment. I must especially
thank Ms Ho Hui Lin and Ms Sylvia Soh for kindling my passions in History
and Literature - passions that define me today.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a sapling, I have worked to build my own integrity, brick by brick,

<p>It is such an honour to have been awarded the Stephen Loh Sports Excellence
Award. Throughout my six years in the College’s Shooting Club, I have come
to appreciate how being a sportsperson is more than just celebrating the
wins. I have experienced ups and downs - from winning competitions to facing
challenges during training. Being in the National Youth Team, I found it
not so easy to balance my academic work and sporting commitments, but this
taught me the importance of self-discipline. Many people have also supported
me: my family, teachers and friends who were always encouraging, and my
coaches who spurred me to reach greater heights. I have learnt what it
is to exemplify sportsmanship, to show respect to others, to constantly
remain committed to growth and to inspire my peers to be passionate and
resilient in their sporting endeavours. This award, to me, is not just
a celebration of my achievements but also a testament to a fulfilling journey,
to the valuable experiences I have gained thus far. The lessons I have
learnt in my sporting journey will continue to stay with me - for they
are lifelong and unforgettable.</p>

<p>I am honoured to have been selected for the Stephen Loh Sports Excellence
Award. I would not have been able to get to where I am without the support
of my friends, teachers and coaches in NJC. Although I was in NJ Track
and Field for 2 years, the friends I made there and my coaches have pushed
me to heights I never thought was possible. They encouraged me to carry
on even when I couldn’t push on during training. I learnt how to lead my
peers as an event Captain, with mentoring support from my teachers and
coaches along the way. I learnt that sportsmanship is not simply about
being good at the sport you play, but also about hard work, discipline,
leadership and humility. I hope that the sports scene can continue to grow
in these four aspects, towards an exciting future for NJC sports!</p>

<p>Being able to play basketball and represent NJC has been a huge blessing
to me. The last six years have shaped me to be a better person by inculcating
a sense of discipline, commitment, where it was important to show up even
when the going got tough. Basketball is a team sport and being part of
a team means belonging to something bigger than myself. It places others
above self and taught me what it means to invest time and effort to support
my teammates, to build a culture of trust, camaraderie and a sense of mission
to move as one. Reflecting on this journey, I am deeply appreciative of
teachers, coaches and seniors for their guidance, and teammates who have
stood by me. Through these years, I have seen how perseverance and resilience
build strength of character, especially when we fail and resolutely pick
ourselves up. These little building blocks and memories mould us and are
valuable life lessons that we carry through to adulthood, reminding me
of a core tenet of Team NJC’s basketball commandment of being unbeatable
when standing together.</p>

<p>I believe that having a sense of Loyalty is not limited to leaders or
exco members; each CCA members’ loyalty means that they put in their best
effort in everything they do for the CCA, and this makes a massive difference.
I have had a very close connection to the String Orchestra for a very long
time, starting from when my brother joined the orchestra in 2019. I was
allowed to participate in a masterclass and a few rehearsals with NJCSO
before I even joined the school. I had the opportunity to interact with
the Stringers and socialise with them. All this allowed me to establish
a bond with the orchestra early on, and that was when my mind was set on
being part of the NJCSO family. I am extremely appreciative of the opportunities
the teachers have given me – what are the chances that one gets to play
in masterclasses with internationally acclaimed cellists and travel overseas
with the friends doing what they love? Because of my CCA mates and teachers,
I was able to enjoy every moment spent in NJC, and I am ever ready to go
above and beyond my responsibilities as a Stringer to always give my very
best for my teachers and friends.</p>

<p>Stepping into NJC in 2019, I was a little girl with limited confidence
in my leadership abilities and never thought to step up as one. My first
exposure as a student leader was when I was appointed the Values-in-Action
representative of my lower JH class. Under the guidance of my teachers
and taking the chance to spearhead the class’s discussions, I slowly felt
comfortable in my role. I found fulfilment in forging meaningful connections
with others, listening to my fellow leaders and those we aim to serve,
and working towards our common goal. Throughout my time in NJC, I have
learnt that leadership is about empowering others — providing platforms
for our fellow leaders to contribute and supporting them in their growth.
It is a profound honour to receive the Outstanding Leadership Award as
it signifies my growth in NJC over the past six years. More importantly,
it is a testament to the community’s efforts in cultivating me into who
I am today.</p>

back after school to plan initiatives with my CCA, navigating difficult
conversations as a Peer Support Leader, and learning how to be present
for others during uncertain times. These experiences showed me that leadership
is rarely about standing at the front, it’s about standing with others,
building trust, and growing alongside them. These experiences taught me
that real leadership means listening deeply, following through on commitments,
and doing the right thing even when no one is watching. It’s in these quiet
decisions and steady actions that integrity is built and sustained. I’m
deeply grateful to receive this award as it serves as a reminder of those
who have walked this journey with me — those who encouraged, challenged,
and supported me in ways that allowed me to learn and lead with greater
purpose. This experience has also deepened my appreciation for the collective
effort behind every milestone. It is the persistence, generosity, and loyalty
of many—driven by a shared commitment to something greater—that empower
us to value the experience as much as we value the outcomes. That, to me,
is what makes this journey truly lasting.</p>

<p>I am extremely honoured to receive the Outstanding Leadership Award. Personally,
leadership is about bridging connections with people, journeying together
as one whilst uplifting others. Above all, leadership encompasses service
with loyalty, integrity, respect and humility whilst upholding one’s moral
values especially when faced with dilemmas. NJ has taught me how service
through the smallest actions, like being present for others to lending
a listening ear, goes a long way to make a difference in forging an inclusive
and united community which helps us to take bigger leaps together. Ultimately,
leadership is about willingly serving others around us no matter the size
of our actions, community and titles we hold. Although my journey was fraught
with challenges, I believe that these hurdles serve as learning opportunities
for me to learn and grow as a person. I am deeply thankful for the unwavering
support and dedication my teachers, friends and family have given me throughout
my 2 years in NJ. I am very grateful for the myriad of opportunities NJ
has given to me to serve the community in several ways. Looking back, my
time in NJ has been a fulfilling one filled with valuable lessons and countless
memories that I will forever treasure.</p>

<p>Receiving this award is a humbling honour. It reflects not just my personal
journey, but the collective strength of those I’ve led and learned from.
The leadership opportunities I’ve had at NJC have taught me that true leadership
isn’t about being in front—it’s about standing beside others, especially
when the stakes are high. As a captain, loyalty meant showing up consistently
for my team, not just during matches, but in early mornings, tough training
sessions, and difficult moments of self-doubt. It was about being a dependable
presence, someone my teammates could count on both on and off the field.
Integrity guided every decision I made. I learned that leadership isn’t
about giving orders, it’s about listening with empathy and making the right
choices, even when they’re difficult. Whether it meant taking responsibility
for my mistakes or standing up for what was fair, I aimed to lead in a
way that fostered trust and mutual respect. I truly resonate with the quote,
“The servant-leader is servant first. It begins with the natural feeling
that one wants to serve, to serve first.” If someone asks why I serve,
I can only say—I don’t know exactly. It’s just a feeling! And this feeling
has guided every step of my leadership journey in NJC.</p>

<p>I am truly honoured to receive this award. To me, a leader is someone
who acts with kindness and integrity, while striving to be the best version
of themselves — a best friend, a best teammate, a best student. I am thankful
to have been surrounded by the amazing people in NJC who modelled what
it means to be a leader, and the safe space provided for me to grow as
a leader. My NJ journey has been defined by the relationships that I have
forged over the years. The friends I have made are amongst the most loyal
and supportive groups of people I have ever met — we helped each other
through tough times and celebrated each other’s wins. We worked hard together,
and played even harder together. I would not be who I am today without
the support of all my friends. To all my friends, thank you from the bottom
of my heart. My teachers and mentors have also helped shape who I am and
gave me the confidence to pursue my passions, and I am forever grateful
to them. I hope to continue to grow as a leader and serve my community
in meaningful ways.</p>

<p>My time at NJC has certainly been an eventful journey, one that has shaped
both my character and my values. Through commitments I have undertaken
over the years, I have been fortunate to be mentored by teachers who went
the extra mile and showed me genuine care while consistently keeping track
of my personal growth. Their sincere dedication towards developing me all-roundedly
extended beyond the classroom, as they often checked in on me, encouraging
my interests and guiding me through challenges. Their belief in me has
been an anchor, and without their care and support, I wouldn’t have the
confidence I have today. Equally important to my journey were the seniors
who first welcomed me when I started undertaking more extracurricular commitments
like Student Council. They went out of their way to show me the ropes and
helped me develop a strong work ethic. It was through them that I learned
to be self-sufficient, focused, and meticulous in my work, and the skills
and mindset I possess today are a direct result of being inspired by them
when I first joined as a clueless junior. This ties in well with this year’s
theme - Loyalty in builders, Integrity in Bricks. The people who have stood
by me throughout my time in Junior High are also those who have built me
up into who I am today, from a lost and easily stressed JH1 to someone
who has better composure and undertakes responsibilities with grit, hard
work and motivation — but more importantly, with the spirit of serving
with honour.</p>

<p><strong><u>The Elizabeth Poey Inspiration and Courage Award</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Elizabeth Poey Inspiration and Courage (EPIC) Award is designed to
recognise and celebrate outstanding students, from all academic levels,
who have shown the courage and vision to actively advocate for transformational
change in Singapore society or in the world. This award is the first team
award designed in National Junior College and is the first step towards
stimulating a greater adventurous spirit and a “rugged society” mentality
in a collaborative manner amongst NJC students.</p>

</div>
<p>The Hillcrest Wildflowers comprises 112 students from National Junior
College who partnered with Wildflower Studio SG to rescue and take care
of stray cats that are then fostered and put up for adoption. The programme
supports the beneficiary in meeting various animal welfare needs and raising
funds for the cause. Since 2023, our volunteers have visited the studio
on a daily basis to help with feeding, cleaning and socialising the cats.
The dynamic and ever changing nature of our work has developed adaptable
and resourceful problem solvers, as we learned to make tutorial videos,
info-sheets and more to train all volunteers to be qualified to handle
any situation, such as medical emergencies or urgent rescue cases. Trust
between the volunteers and the studio owners – Darius Low and Amanda Cho
– is essential in maintaining good working relationships and ensuring every
cat is well cared for. From ill, feral, or even pregnant cats, our volunteers
have grown to overcome their initial fears of handling live animals, and
gained a deeper understanding into Singapore's animal rescue and welfare
scene. With over 300 fostered and 200 rehomed cats, our efforts have helped
our furry feline friends find new families, and we hope to continue touching
the lives of more pets and owners.</p>

<p>Integrating aspects from Overseas Values-In-Action and Youth Leadership
Training Camp, the yearly SLTC programme nurtures Servant Leaders who are
authentic and build up the people around them. In November 2024’s SLTC,
78 Student CCA Leaders and 14 Teachers from National Junior College partnered
with Sambour Primary School in Siem Reap, Cambodia to teach, inspire and
raise funds for the students. We contributed to the Cambodian community
with skills transfer through hands-on experiments, interactive games and
personalised teaching. Over the weeks spent bonding with our buddies, we
inspired them to strive for different career paths and guided them on external
learning journeys, such as to the iconic UNESCO temple, Angkor Wat. They
warmly welcomed us into their rich culture, and through them we gained
a broadened worldview, new convictions, and a sense of gratefulness. Although
the eventual farewell was bittersweet and teary, we left knowing we were
part of a successful long-lasting collaboration where NJC has maintained
consistent efforts with the beneficiary including and especially when times
get tough. Each year of donations contributes towards building a safer
and more conducive school environment, and each year of NJCians fostering
genuine connections with the Cambodian students goes a long way in ensuring
an effective rippling impact.</p>

<p>It has been a true honour to serve NJC for over 20 years — a journey that
has shaped not only my professional path, but also, my personal growth.
Being part of a community that nurtures young minds and celebrates excellence
has filled me with immense pride.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’m deeply grateful for the unconditional support from all my colleagues,
the teaching staff, and students over the past years I've had the privilege
to work with. While there have been challenges and changes, what stays
with me the most is the enduring sense of purpose, and the meaningful relationships
built over the years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This journey has always been more than just work; it is about growing
together, learning from each other, and fostering a shared commitment.
As I reflect on these years, I feel a profound sense of gratitude for the
bonds formed here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you everyone for being a part of this incredible experience — may
the NJC spirit continue to thrive in each of you.</p>

<p>It is with great pride and humility that I reflect on the remarkable achievement
of thirty years of dedicated service at National Junior College. As I celebrate
this milestone, I extend my deepest gratitude to the College for providing
me with the opportunity to serve and make a difference.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a teacher, my hopes for students are deeply rooted in their growth,
success, and overall well-being. I hope to empower students to believe
in themselves and their abilities. By making education engaging, I want
them to develop a lifelong passion for knowledge and everything they do.
My goal is to have a positive impact on students' lives, shaping their
future and helping them become responsible, compassionate, and well-rounded
individuals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I firmly believe that the phrase “quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to
anger” serves as a guiding principle on how to develop as a good citizen.
As I have applied this phrase in my life, I have also imparted this in
my students for their growth in our society.</p>

<p>It has been a privilege to serve in NJC for so many years. The experience
has been both meaningful and rewarding, as I have not only witnessed the
school’s growth alongside the changing educational landscape, but also
my transformation from a novice teacher to a more confident and competent
educator.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What continues to motivate me over the years is the opportunity to contribute
to the development of young minds. Additionally, the support and professionalism
of my colleagues create a collaborative and safe environment that fosters
continuous learning and growth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I often share with my students, learning math is not just about solving
for the correct answers but being engaged in learning from failures too;
“Mistakes Allow Thinking to Happen” is an acronym for MATH, after all.
I wish for NJC students to embrace lifelong learning, to face challenges
with resilience, and to make meaningful contributions to their communities.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve found immense joy in witnessing my students grow
in confidence, character, and knowledge. Their success—whether big or small—has
always been a source of quiet pride and motivation. I continue to find
fulfilment in the everyday interactions with my students, which keep me
grounded and inspired. Teaching has also been a journey of constant learning
for me; it reminds me to stay curious, adaptable, and open to new perspectives.
The sense of satisfaction that comes from making a difference, even in
small ways, reaffirms my commitment to this profession. I’m grateful for
the opportunities I’ve had and look forward to the continued privilege
of growing alongside the young minds I teach.</p>

<p>I’m humbled to be recognised for my long service at National Junior College.
What keeps me grounded is my passion for teaching and for growing as both
a person and an educator. The opportunities I’ve received here have shown
me how much more I can give back to the community, especially to my students.
Though the years have brought change and challenges, the continuous support
from colleagues and the shared spirit of resilience and altruism have kept
me motivated. The joy of learning from both colleagues and students continues
to inspire me and reminds me why I remain in this profession. I am grateful
to still be in service at NJC – being part of a community where we learn
and grow together, while celebrating the love for what we do, makes me
look forward to coming to school every day.</p>

<p>“Don’t count the years. Make the years count.” is something I believe
in. Throughout these years as a teacher, I’ve never felt the need to count
the years; teaching makes me feel as young as my students!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Every batch of students makes me learn as much as a beginning teacher.
No two years pose the same challenge. No two students pose the same question.
The moment I step into the classroom, I magically transform into someone
who is full of joyful energy. The moment I step out of the classroom, I
instantly return to my human form—a person who worries about time or gets
exhausted from running out of energy. Yet the moment I make a difference
to one life at a time through a smile, a text, or a chat, I am recharged
once more to serve with honour year after year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To the NJCians of every class, I wish you a heart of gold, a peace of
mind, a body of strength, and a soul of light.</p>

<p>Serving in NJC has been very rewarding. I remember clearly wanting to
contribute to the college as a new teacher, but was unclear of where I
belonged at the time. I am glad that I have been afforded the space and
resources to find my true calling and develop my teaching techniques. I
am fortunate to have taught a wonderful collection of students whose enthusiasm
further fueled my desire to do more. From the tiny steps of SPIRE to H3-Star
and then to E-Star, from the east zone science fair to SSEF and ISEF, each
journey makes me realize that this is where I want to be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To my students, teaching you has been the best thing that I have ever
done. You really are wonderful. My advice to you is to do what you want
to achieve. There are risks that need to be taken, but you can manage this
and move forward. For if not now, when?</p>

<p>As I look back on 20 years at National Junior College, I find myself filled
with a mix of pride, gratitude, and a bit of disbelief — has it really
been two decades? When I first started teaching Chemistry here, I thought
I was simply passing on knowledge. I didn’t realise how much my students,
colleagues, and this community would end up teaching me. NJC has been more
than just a workplace; it has been a second home filled with laughter,
learning, and the occasional unexpected lab experiment! Every lesson taught
and every conversation shared has been a reminder of why I chose this path.
I am deeply thankful for the friendships built, the trust given, and the
memories created. As I receive this Long Service Award, I carry with me
not just years of service, but years of meaningful moments that I will
always treasure.</p>

<p>Teaching in NJC has been an incredibly fulfilling journey. Over the years,
I have not only enjoyed the process of guiding and nurturing students,
but I have also grown as an educator and as a person.</p>
<p></p>
<p>NJC has given me countless opportunities to explore, learn, and evolve.
What keeps me going is the spark in my students’ eyes when they finally
grasp a concept they were struggling with, or the joy they show when they
achieve something they worked so hard for.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My hope for our NJC students is that they grow not just academically,
but also in character — to develop a strong sense of purpose and become
compassionate, thoughtful individuals. Moments that bring me the most fulfilment
are when graduated students return, eager to give back and support their
juniors. That’s when I know NJC has done something right. Service with
Honour!</p>

<p>NJC is the school that I’ve spent most of my teaching years in. It is
a dynamic environment where we always reflect on student outcomes and how
we can improve our practice to better meet student needs in a changing
world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is a joy to work with young lives and see each bloom in their own time.
Some hardly need any guidance but for those who do, the impact is life
changing and uplifting even for their families.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through the examples of many dedicated staff they encounter, I hope that
NJC students appreciate the holistic quality education they receive and
are inspired and emboldened to leave a legacy for their future batches
and society as they have been blessed.</p>

<p>As I mark my 15th year as an educator in this college, I feel deeply grateful
for the people I’ve worked alongside—each interaction has brought joy and
inspired me to give my best in helping students learn and grow. While I’ve
light-heartedly told students that “my future depends on theirs,” this
sentiment carries truth: education is the bedrock of sustainable progress.
The world has changed drastically over the past five years, yet my purpose
remains steadfast: to teach, to coach, and to inspire. The greatest challenge
in teaching is balancing adaptability with groundedness—meeting diverse
learning needs while ensuring that every student learns meaningfully. Despite
the changes and challenges, my commitment to being a good teacher endures.
I remain hopeful and dedicated to empowering each student who passes through
my hands, with the hope that they, too, will do good for society.</p>

since retired, I would still like to thank them for guiding me along as

<p></p>
<p>It really does not feel like I have already spent 15 years teaching in
NJC. Every day feels new because of new challenges and opportunities to
develop and grow. The world is constantly changing too, and we learn to
adapt. As I teach my students, I continue to learn from them too. Regardless
of our paths in life, may we continue to find joy in learning.</p>

<p>National Junior College is the first and only school that I have taught
at since I began my teaching career. While I have served in this college
for 15 years, it honestly does not feel like so much time has passed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being a teacher has both its peaks and challenges. While I am here to
help my students learn, I find that I myself have learnt a lot in my journey
as a teacher.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Teaching is undoubtedly tough but what keeps me going is getting to interact
with my students and engaging in conversations with them. This is what
I look forward to the most everyday.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The world is evolving and the challenges we face as a society have changed
tremendously. Thus, I hope that my students look beyond just academic grades
and appreciate that at the end of the day, what is most important, is the
competencies that they develop to stay adaptable and resilient.</p>

<p>As I look back on my years in education, I'm struck by the incredible
journey of learning and growth that teaching has provided. I've seen countless
examples of students overcoming obstacles and achieving their potential,
and that is a constant source of motivation for me. Of course, teaching
has not always been easy. There have been challenges, setbacks, and moments
of doubt. But each of these experiences has taught me valuable lessons
about myself, about teaching, and about the importance of perseverance.
Looking ahead, I am excited about the future of education and the continued
opportunity to make a difference in the lives of young people. My years
of service have not only allowed me to shape the futures of countless individuals
but have also profoundly shaped my own life and growth as an educator.</p>

<p>It feels like it was just yesterday that I first came to NJC but lo and
behold it has already been a fulfilling 15 years here. A lot has changed
and will continue to change but I will always continue to strive and be
the best version of myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Knowing that I’ve played and continue to play a part in ensuring that
practical lessons in the biology labs run smoothly has been a motivation,
as well as the camaraderie I’ve forged with my colleagues all these years.
They’ve definitely made it enjoyable to be working here; many times, we
share the same struggles but we also celebrate our small wins together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hope at the end of the 2 or 6 years in NJC, students will be able to
leave with the knowledge and skills that have been imparted to them and
with confidence I’m sure they’ll be able to make a positive change in the
world.</p>

<p>It’s hard to believe that 15 years have flown by at National Junior College!
Being part of this wonderful NJC family as an Operation Support Officer
has been a truly rewarding experience. Every day, whether helping to set
up events, keeping the campus in order, or lending a hand wherever needed,
has given me a sense of purpose and pride. Along the way, I’ve shared countless
laughs, made great friendships, and collected memories that I will always
treasure. It’s the little moments — a simple thank you, a smile from a
student, or a team effort behind a successful event — that have made this
journey so special. I am grateful to be part of a community where everyone’s
role matters, big or small. As I celebrate this milestone, I look forward

<p>Celebrating a decade of teaching at NJC has been an incredibly rewarding
journey. Over the past ten years, I’ve had the privilege of watching students
grow, learn, and discover their potential. Each classroom experience has
shaped me—not just as an educator, but as a lifelong learner. I’ve built
lasting relationships with colleagues, collaborated on meaningful projects,

<p>I can hardly believe it, but it’s been 10 years since I first walked into
NJC. That’s right, a full decade of blowing whistles, dodging flying frisbees,
and reminding students that running is not optional. When I first started,
I had one mission: to make a positive impact (and maybe survive friendly
games without straining my hamstring). Ten years later, the mission stands
strong, though my knees now provide a running commentary every time I demonstrate
a lunge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over these years, I have picked up some vital survival skills, like thriving
on canteen kopi and operating a stubborn projector through sheer willpower.
At NJC, two guiding principles have kept me going: “Safety first” (especially
when sprinting across the field to chase students indoors during lightning
alert) and “Students first” because, let’s face it, they are the reason
we are here (and also the reason we occasionally question our sanity).</p>
<p></p>
<p>To my students, thank you for your energy, your humour, and your never-ending
supply of creative excuses. To my colleagues, thank you for your support,
friendship, and emergency snacks.</p>

<p>2015 marked the beginning of my 17th year in teaching—and my first at
NJC. Now, many moons and monsoons later, it is 2025. These ten years have
been filled with vibrancy and personal growth. I embraced new ideas through
enriching professional development opportunities, found inspiration in
the everyday rhythms of school life, and built meaningful connections with
colleagues and students. Over time, those connections blossomed into friendships
that extend far beyond the workplace. NJC became more than just a place
to teach—it became a space of growth, and a trove of memories. For all
these experiences, I am deeply grateful. As I look to the future, I carry
the faith and hope that each NJCian will continue to grow with confidence,
curiosity, and the courage to shape a meaningful world.</p>

<p>For teachers, the connections we form with our students are what make
our work special. It really means a lot when students want to know us beyond
the classroom or when they open up and share more than just “I’m okay”.
We walk alongside them on their journey, believing that some may just need
a bit more time to find their way, discover who they are, and choose who
— not what — they want to be. I’m glad that as a teaching community, we
have a hand in nurturing students who value kindness and human connection
above all else.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond the meaningful interactions with students, I’m also really thankful
for the friendships among colleagues. They are the ones who look out for
one another, always ready to help, share advice, or just listen. I’m also
thankful for our school leadership who stands firmly behind us, always
supporting the work we do. Looking back, it’s been a wonderful ten years
at NJC, and I’m really happy to be here!</p>

Over the past decade at National Junior College, I have found deep fulfillment

<p>Teaching at NJC for all these years has been such a great journey. I’ve
learned that teaching isn’t just about getting through lessons, it’s about
building connections, getting students to be curious, and creating a classroom

finally understand something, they’ve been struggling with, is one of the
best parts. It’s not only about academic growth but watching them grow
as people too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What keeps me going is knowing that the impact we have here really lasts.
Education shapes so much of my students' futures, and it’s amazing to be
part of that. NJC has been a place where I’ve grown and every year brings
something new, but the sense of community here always keeps me inspired.
My hope for our students is that they become men and women that embody

<p>Honestly, I am beyond thankful and grateful for my time here in NJC. To
be surrounded by such a great community is indeed a blessing. In particular,
my students, past and present, are constant reminders of why I love to
teach. My hope for our NJC students is this – they go out there and do
good for the community.</p>

<p>I feel privileged to be part of a community that values both academic
rigour and character development. What keeps me going is the opportunity
to witness growth in students, watching students discover their strengths,
overcome challenges, and become thoughtful and capable individuals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My hope for NJC students is that they continue to embrace curiosity and
stay resilient in face of adversity. “When you come out of the storm, you
won’t be the same person who walked in.” Keep going – you are growing in
ways you may not yet see.</p>
