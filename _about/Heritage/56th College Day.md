<summary><strong>Loyalty in the Builders, Integrity in the Bricks</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>This theme highlights the interplay between the builders – the individuals
who contribute through their effort, vision, and dedication to shaping
a brighter future for all, and the bricks – the steadfast value of integrity
that forms the foundation of lasting success. Loyalty reflects the builders’
commitment to the shared purpose, and integrity embodies the strength and
reliability of the actions and principles that hold everything together.
Just as a well-built structure stands firm through the synergy of both,
our College thrives when these virtues are upheld. Hence, at this College
Day, we honour those who have upheld these values by leading with moral
courage, uplifting others, and striving for excellence.</p>

<p><strong><u>The NJC Student of the Year</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The National Junior College Student of the Year is the pinnacle of all
student awards, recognising all-round excellence in academia, CCA, leadership
and service.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>LUO CHANG</strong>
</p>
<p>My six years in NJC are marked by deep gratitude for the faculty, facilities,
and friends who have shaped my journey. The College’s culture of care has
nurtured me holistically and inspired me to give back through service.
Through this, I’ve realised that we are all on the same team, fighting
the same battles, where everyone has a place to serve with honour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, we each find gratitude in our own way. For my foodie friends,
it’s the basil pork with extra scoops of chilli at the canteen. For the
science-y ones, it’s the thrill of using the NMR machine in the Sigma Lab.
But no matter what draws us in, we build love for the community in our
own ways, lay our own bricks, and make our own difference.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’m deeply honoured to receive the Student of the Year Award, a recognition
I owe to the passionate teachers and friends who have supported me, brick
by brick.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moving forward, I hope we can find inspiration in the foundation laid
by the lineage of builders before us, and choose to serve with love and
honour, letting our NJ tower stand one brick taller.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>The Lim Kim Woon Award</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Lim Kim Woon Award, initiated and structured by a former NJCian in
honour of our first Principal, recognises students who exemplify the hallmark
characteristics and traits of our motto, Service with Honour.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANGELENE KHO KAR YI</strong>
</p>
<p>I am truly honoured to be receiving the Lim Kim Woon Award, and would
like to thank my teachers, friends, and family who have stood by me and
supported me throughout my journey in NJC.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Service with Honour” is especially meaningful to me because I want to
reach out to those who may not be as privileged as I am. Service, to me,
is about recognising that everyone’s situation is different, and asking
how I can use my strengths and resources to help in whatever way I can.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In NJC, I have been blessed with many opportunities to take part in community
service projects, and I believe this ignited the passion in me to continue
serving. Through these experiences, I’ve learnt that service is not a one-time
event, but a mindset we carry into every interaction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Receiving this award motivates me to continue serving with compassion
and integrity and, more importantly, to inspire others to do the same.
I hope that through my actions, more people will be encouraged to lead
with kindness, serve with honour, and make a difference in the lives of
those around them, no matter how small.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TOH SHI JIE</strong>
</p>
<p>Reflecting on my journey in NJC, a word I believe encapsulates my experience
as an NJCian is kindness - specifically, the many acts of kindness I was
fortunate enough to witness and receive over the past six years, which
broadened my understanding of what it means to serve with honour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whether it was the unwavering support and guidance of teachers who dedicated
themselves to our growth as individuals, or the compassion of peers, seniors,
and alumni who addressed my many questions and alleviated my concerns,
these interactions inspired me to give back, and fostered a firm belief
that no act of kindness is ever too small.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If my time at NJC has taught me anything, it’s that everyone has the potential
to make a positive impact on another’s life. Whether we choose to lead,
volunteer, or uplift those around us, the support we offer can comfort,
the values we embody can inspire, and the dedication we bring to our projects
can make their impact ever more profound.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am deeply honoured to receive the Lim Kim Woon Award, and am immensely
grateful for the unyielding support of my friends and teachers who have
encouraged and inspired me along the way.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>The SAC Arts Excellence Award</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The SAC Arts Excellence Award recognises academic excellence in the arts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>LIAN YUYANG</strong>
</p>
<p>Receiving this award is both fulfilling and, admittedly, a bit of a surprise
to me. When I first encountered English-dependent subjects like History
and Literature, they felt almost too foreign and intimidating - full of
dates, metaphors, and complex theories. I remember thinking, What have
I gotten myself into? I even began to question my choice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But, as with all good stories, there were guides along the way - teachers
and staff in NJC. They patiently explained, reassured, and never let me
feel like I wasn't capable. Their belief in me was the scaffolding that
helped me climb from confusion to clarity. Meanwhile, I spent countless
hours devouring books, notes, and online resources like the Internet Archive.
Slowly, the subjects transformed from obstacles into pure passions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A testament to the NJC staff who laid the foundation, and to the integrity
of hard work and persistence that made me who I am, this award is as much
theirs as it is mine. Indeed, a teacher's tale dwells in every student:
for in the grand structure of dreams, there is loyalty in the builders,
and integrity in the bricks.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TASYA DARAMALINGGAM</strong>
</p>
<p>In my time studying the humanities, the values of loyalty and integrity
were key in discussions, essays, and reflections. Staying true to one’s
beliefs while making the effort to understand alternate perspectives was
what allowed my peers and me to engage in rich debates, mutually building
up our knowledge and growing alongside each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being a humanities student was a challenging yet rewarding journey, as
my understanding of the world around me was constantly taken apart and
reformed. Coming to terms with diverse perspectives and conflicting ideas
honed my analytical skills, pushing me to reflect more deeply. Through
my exploration of the human experience and the global political and economic
landscape, I have been well equipped to understand the changing world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am truly grateful to the teachers who took the time to understand each
one of us, challenging our thinking and believing in us throughout. Their
passion and love for their subjects made my lessons with them thoroughly
memorable, with many of their humorous anecdotes from class still fresh
in my mind. The encouragement and support they provided have greatly deepened
my enjoyment of the humanities, and I would definitely recommend giving
the humanities a try.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>The SAC Science Excellence Award</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The SAC Science Excellence Award recognises excellence in the sciences,
both in core curricula and in co-curricular scientific endeavours.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>GALEN GAY</strong>
</p>
<p>Receiving the SAC Science Excellence Award is both a humbling and affirming
moment to cap off my NJC journey. From trying to find my bearings in the
SPIRE programme as a wide-eyed student in Junior High to becoming a confident
scientific communicator through the NUS-A*STAR-NJC Research Programme,
my scientific journey has been paved by numerous trailblazers before me:
teachers who dedicated countless hours drawing up lesson plans, liaising
with external partners, and patiently mentoring me; seniors who generously
gave their time to tutor, guide, and collate learning materials; and administrative
staff who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure the smooth operation
of school programmes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To me, this award is the product of their support and steadfast loyalty,
from which I have benefited immensely. Alongside that loyalty, I have found
personal integrity to be a key determinant in this achievement. Through
my research experience, I learnt to stay true to my moral pillars, whether
it was reporting unfavourable results or acknowledging uncertainties.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond the individual, I have come to recognise that personal integrity
is also integral to the collective strength of the student body - laying,
brick by brick, the foundations of a robust support network for batches
of NJCians to come.</p>

<p><strong><u>The SAC Sports Excellence Award</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The SAC Sports Excellence Award is the pinnacle sports award, recognising
sportsmanship and sporting excellence.</p>
