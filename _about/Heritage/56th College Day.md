<summary><strong>Loyalty in the Builders, Integrity in the Bricks</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>This theme highlights the interplay between the builders – the individuals
who contribute through their effort, vision, and dedication to shaping
a brighter future for all, and the bricks – the steadfast value of integrity
that forms the foundation of lasting success. Loyalty reflects the builders’
commitment to the shared purpose, and integrity embodies the strength and
reliability of the actions and principles that hold everything together.
Just as a well-built structure stands firm through the synergy of both,
our College thrives when these virtues are upheld. Hence, at this College
Day, we honour those who have upheld these values by leading with moral
courage, uplifting others, and striving for excellence.</p>

<p><strong><u>The NJC Student of the Year</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The National Junior College Student of the Year is the pinnacle of all
student awards, recognising all-round excellence in academia, CCA, leadership
and service.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>LUO CHANG</strong>
</p>
<p>My six years in NJC are marked by deep gratitude for the faculty, facilities,
and friends who have shaped my journey. The College’s culture of care has
nurtured me holistically and inspired me to give back through service.
Through this, I’ve realised that we are all on the same team, fighting
the same battles, where everyone has a place to serve with honour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, we each find gratitude in our own way. For my foodie friends,
it’s the basil pork with extra scoops of chilli at the canteen. For the
science-y ones, it’s the thrill of using the NMR machine in the Sigma Lab.
But no matter what draws us in, we build love for the community in our
own ways, lay our own bricks, and make our own difference.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’m deeply honoured to receive the Student of the Year Award, a recognition
I owe to the passionate teachers and friends who have supported me, brick
by brick.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moving forward, I hope we can find inspiration in the foundation laid
by the lineage of builders before us, and choose to serve with love and
honour, letting our NJ tower stand one brick taller.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>The Lim Kim Woon Award</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Lim Kim Woon Award, initiated and structured by a former NJCian in
honour of our first Principal, recognises students who exemplify the hallmark
characteristics and traits of our motto, Service with Honour.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ANGELENE KHO KAR YI</strong>
</p>
<p>I am truly honoured to be receiving the Lim Kim Woon Award, and would
like to thank my teachers, friends, and family who have stood by me and
supported me throughout my journey in NJC.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Service with Honour” is especially meaningful to me because I want to
reach out to those who may not be as privileged as I am. Service, to me,
is about recognising that everyone’s situation is different, and asking
how I can use my strengths and resources to help in whatever way I can.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In NJC, I have been blessed with many opportunities to take part in community
service projects, and I believe this ignited the passion in me to continue
serving. Through these experiences, I’ve learnt that service is not a one-time
event, but a mindset we carry into every interaction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Receiving this award motivates me to continue serving with compassion
and integrity and, more importantly, to inspire others to do the same.
I hope that through my actions, more people will be encouraged to lead
with kindness, serve with honour, and make a difference in the lives of
those around them, no matter how small.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TOH SHI JIE</strong>
</p>
<p>Reflecting on my journey in NJC, a word I believe encapsulates my experience
as an NJCian is kindness - specifically, the many acts of kindness I was
fortunate enough to witness and receive over the past six years, which
broadened my understanding of what it means to serve with honour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whether it was the unwavering support and guidance of teachers who dedicated
themselves to our growth as individuals, or the compassion of peers, seniors,
and alumni who addressed my many questions and alleviated my concerns,
these interactions inspired me to give back, and fostered a firm belief
that no act of kindness is ever too small.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If my time at NJC has taught me anything, it’s that everyone has the potential
to make a positive impact on another’s life. Whether we choose to lead,
volunteer, or uplift those around us, the support we offer can comfort,
the values we embody can inspire, and the dedication we bring to our projects
can make their impact ever more profound.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am deeply honoured to receive the Lim Kim Woon Award, and am immensely
grateful for the unyielding support of my friends and teachers who have
encouraged and inspired me along the way.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>The SAC Arts Excellence Award</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The SAC Arts Excellence Award recognises academic excellence in the arts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>LIAN YUYANG</strong>
</p>
<p>Receiving this award is both fulfilling and, admittedly, a bit of a surprise
to me. When I first encountered English-dependent subjects like History
and Literature, they felt almost too foreign and intimidating - full of
dates, metaphors, and complex theories. I remember thinking, What have
I gotten myself into? I even began to question my choice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But, as with all good stories, there were guides along the way - teachers
and staff in NJC. They patiently explained, reassured, and never let me
feel like I wasn't capable. Their belief in me was the scaffolding that
helped me climb from confusion to clarity. Meanwhile, I spent countless
hours devouring books, notes, and online resources like the Internet Archive.
Slowly, the subjects transformed from obstacles into pure passions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A testament to the NJC staff who laid the foundation, and to the integrity
of hard work and persistence that made me who I am, this award is as much
theirs as it is mine. Indeed, a teacher's tale dwells in every student:
for in the grand structure of dreams, there is loyalty in the builders,
and integrity in the bricks.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TASYA DARAMALINGGAM</strong>
</p>
<p>In my time studying the humanities, the values of loyalty and integrity
were key in discussions, essays, and reflections. Staying true to one’s
beliefs while making the effort to understand alternate perspectives was
what allowed my peers and me to engage in rich debates, mutually building
up our knowledge and growing alongside each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being a humanities student was a challenging yet rewarding journey, as
my understanding of the world around me was constantly taken apart and
reformed. Coming to terms with diverse perspectives and conflicting ideas
honed my analytical skills, pushing me to reflect more deeply. Through
my exploration of the human experience and the global political and economic
landscape, I have been well equipped to understand the changing world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am truly grateful to the teachers who took the time to understand each
one of us, challenging our thinking and believing in us throughout. Their
passion and love for their subjects made my lessons with them thoroughly
memorable, with many of their humorous anecdotes from class still fresh
in my mind. The encouragement and support they provided have greatly deepened
my enjoyment of the humanities, and I would definitely recommend giving
the humanities a try.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>The SAC Science Excellence Award</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The SAC Science Excellence Award recognises excellence in the sciences,
both in core curricula and in co-curricular scientific endeavours.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>GALEN GAY</strong>
</p>
<p>Receiving the SAC Science Excellence Award is both a humbling and affirming
moment to cap off my NJC journey. From trying to find my bearings in the
SPIRE programme as a wide-eyed student in Junior High to becoming a confident
scientific communicator through the NUS-A*STAR-NJC Research Programme,
my scientific journey has been paved by numerous trailblazers before me:
teachers who dedicated countless hours drawing up lesson plans, liaising
with external partners, and patiently mentoring me; seniors who generously
gave their time to tutor, guide, and collate learning materials; and administrative
staff who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure the smooth operation
of school programmes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To me, this award is the product of their support and steadfast loyalty,
from which I have benefited immensely. Alongside that loyalty, I have found
personal integrity to be a key determinant in this achievement. Through
my research experience, I learnt to stay true to my moral pillars, whether
it was reporting unfavourable results or acknowledging uncertainties.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond the individual, I have come to recognise that personal integrity
is also integral to the collective strength of the student body - laying,
brick by brick, the foundations of a robust support network for batches
of NJCians to come.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>The SAC Sports Excellence Award</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The SAC Sports Excellence Award is the pinnacle sports award, recognising
sportsmanship and sporting excellence.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ARIEL LIN JING HAN</strong>
</p>
<p>I am truly honoured to receive this SAC sports excellence award. Receiving
this award really makes me feel like all my hard work paid off and motivates
me to work even harder to become better in my sport and as a person as
well. I really do believe that sports isn’t just about winning, but it’s
about building a good character. Be it perseverance, kindness or integrity,
the values that you can learn are endless! Personally, I feel that I've
become more resilient through my sports, and I've learnt to not give up
the moment I encounter problems, or stop trying when I know I can't do
it. It has truly taught me to do my very best in every circumstance and
no matter what the result is, it’s okay because I know I gave it my all!
So, I just want to encourage anyone who reads this to keep on trying! And
ultimately, it’s not about the results or medals you win, but the values
you’ve learnt that stick with you for the rest of your life.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TAMARA TYLES</strong>
</p>
<p>My journey in NJC has been shaped by the people who stood by me, especially
when I felt like giving up. One moment I’ll never forget was in Secondary
2, during the 400m finals. Having fallen just before the finish line, it
felt like everything I had worked for slipped away in that instant. But
my teachers and coaches never let that moment define me. Their belief taught
me that failure isn’t the end, and gave me the strength to pick myself
up — both on and off the track. That experience showed me the meaning of
“Loyalty in the Builders, Integrity in the Bricks.” Loyalty is about people
standing by you at your lowest, and integrity is about staying true to
your values, even when no one’s watching. Receiving this award reminds
me of how much I’ve grown, and how much I owe to the community that believed
in me through every high and low. I’ll be proud to carry these lessons
with me, long after I leave NJC.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ESTHER SIAK KA YEE</strong>
</p>
<p>Before coming to NJ, I would have never imagined myself winning a sports
award. I had thought that student athletes were hardcore and dedicated
but also wasting their time on an activity they might not even be doing
a few years down the road — until I became one myself. Canoeing has really
taught me what being an athlete is — not just as a racer but as a person.
Together in the gruelling training sessions, we were disciplined, racing
in different competitions. I would be lying if I said I had never thought
of just quitting this sport because of the sheer amount of mental pressure
it gave me. However, I chose to stay and keep pushing on because of my
seniors who had chosen to stay for the team. “I feel like my work here
isn’t done” was their reply to my question on why they stayed in this CCA.
It has inspired me to keep pushing on, not just in the sport but for the
team as well, coming together to build a community and as a team to lift
one another up. Thank you to my coaches, teachers and teammates for the
heart and effort you have put into this CCA.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>The NJC@69ners Award</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The NJC@69ers award, initiated and structured by the first cohort of NJCians,
recognises excellence in the arts and humanities, both in core-curricular
and co-curricular endeavours.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>LIAN YUYANG</strong>
</p>
<p>Receiving this award feels like a moment where all the pieces of my academic
and co-curricular journeys in the arts and humanities align gracefully.
My role as Vice President of the Editorial Club, and the countless hours
spent preparing for writing and recital competitions - these experiences
have been my canvas, painted with perseverance and avid enthusiasm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I owe this recognition to my teachers, who’ve been loyal builders, laying
down the foundation of wisdom with unwavering commitment. I must especially
thank Ms Ho Hui Lin and Ms Sylvia Soh for kindling my passions in History
and Literature - passions that define me today.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a sapling, I have worked to build my own integrity, brick by brick,
through every edit and every line written. It is the trust and guidance
of my educators that have allowed me to stand strong, enabling me to venture
further on my chosen path.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>The Stephen Loh Sports Excellence Award</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Stephen Loh Sports Excellence Award is the pinnacle sports award,
recognising sportsmanship and sporting excellence in Track &amp; Field,
Squash and Canoeing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>LOVELEY NG</strong>
</p>
<p>It is such an honour to have been awarded the Stephen Loh Sports Excellence
Award. Throughout my six years in the College’s Shooting Club, I have come
to appreciate how being a sportsperson is more than just celebrating the
wins. I have experienced ups and downs - from winning competitions to facing
challenges during training. Being in the National Youth Team, I found it
not so easy to balance my academic work and sporting commitments, but this
taught me the importance of self-discipline. Many people have also supported
me: my family, teachers and friends who were always encouraging, and my
coaches who spurred me to reach greater heights. I have learnt what it
is to exemplify sportsmanship, to show respect to others, to constantly
remain committed to growth and to inspire my peers to be passionate and
resilient in their sporting endeavours. This award, to me, is not just
a celebration of my achievements but also a testament to a fulfilling journey,
to the valuable experiences I have gained thus far. The lessons I have
learnt in my sporting journey will continue to stay with me - for they
are lifelong and unforgettable.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>LOH HIN YIN, LANGSTON</strong>
</p>
<p>I am honoured to have been selected for the Stephen Loh Sports Excellence
Award. I would not have been able to get to where I am without the support
of my friends, teachers and coaches in NJC. Although I was in NJ Track
and Field for 2 years, the friends I made there and my coaches have pushed
me to heights I never thought was possible. They encouraged me to carry
on even when I couldn’t push on during training. I learnt how to lead my
peers as an event Captain, with mentoring support from my teachers and
coaches along the way. I learnt that sportsmanship is not simply about
being good at the sport you play, but also about hard work, discipline,
leadership and humility. I hope that the sports scene can continue to grow
in these four aspects, towards an exciting future for NJC sports!</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TAN PENG RUI LAUREN</strong>

<p>Being able to play basketball and represent NJC has been a huge blessing
to me. The last six years have shaped me to be a better person by inculcating
a sense of discipline, commitment, where it was important to show up even
when the going got tough. Basketball is a team sport and being part of
a team means belonging to something bigger than myself. It places others
above self and taught me what it means to invest time and effort to support
my teammates, to build a culture of trust, camaraderie and a sense of mission
to move as one. Reflecting on this journey, I am deeply appreciative of
teachers, coaches and seniors for their guidance, and teammates who have
stood by me. Through these years, I have seen how perseverance and resilience
build strength of character, especially when we fail and resolutely pick
ourselves up. These little building blocks and memories mould us and are
valuable life lessons that we carry through to adulthood, reminding me
of a core tenet of Team NJC’s basketball commandment of being unbeatable
when standing together.</p>

<p><strong>AIDAN YEONG LEE HENG</strong>
</p>
<p>I believe that having a sense of Loyalty is not limited to leaders or
exco members; each CCA members’ loyalty means that they put in their best
effort in everything they do for the CCA, and this makes a massive difference.
I have had a very close connection to the String Orchestra for a very long
time, starting from when my brother joined the orchestra in 2019. I was
allowed to participate in a masterclass and a few rehearsals with NJCSO
before I even joined the school. I had the opportunity to interact with
the Stringers and socialise with them. All this allowed me to establish
a bond with the orchestra early on, and that was when my mind was set on
being part of the NJCSO family. I am extremely appreciative of the opportunities
the teachers have given me – what are the chances that one gets to play
in masterclasses with internationally acclaimed cellists and travel overseas
with the friends doing what they love? Because of my CCA mates and teachers,
I was able to enjoy every moment spent in NJC, and I am ever ready to go
above and beyond my responsibilities as a Stringer to always give my very
best for my teachers and friends.</p>

<p><strong><u>The Outstanding Leadership Award	</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Outstanding Leadership Award recognises student leaders who have displayed
leadership with sensitivity and service with honour.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>GOH YU XIN</strong>
</p>
<p>Stepping into NJC in 2019, I was a little girl with limited confidence
in my leadership abilities and never thought to step up as one. My first
exposure as a student leader was when I was appointed the Values-in-Action
representative of my lower JH class. Under the guidance of my teachers
and taking the chance to spearhead the class’s discussions, I slowly felt
comfortable in my role. I found fulfilment in forging meaningful connections
with others, listening to my fellow leaders and those we aim to serve,
and working towards our common goal. Throughout my time in NJC, I have
learnt that leadership is about empowering others — providing platforms
for our fellow leaders to contribute and supporting them in their growth.
It is a profound honour to receive the Outstanding Leadership Award as
it signifies my growth in NJC over the past six years. More importantly,
it is a testament to the community’s efforts in cultivating me into who
I am today.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>LEOW ZI HAN GERMAINE</strong>
</p>
<p>My journey in NJC has been shaped by rewarding moments, such as staying
back after school to plan initiatives with my CCA, navigating difficult
conversations as a Peer Support Leader, and learning how to be present
for others during uncertain times. These experiences showed me that leadership
is rarely about standing at the front, it’s about standing with others,
building trust, and growing alongside them. These experiences taught me
that real leadership means listening deeply, following through on commitments,
and doing the right thing even when no one is watching. It’s in these quiet
decisions and steady actions that integrity is built and sustained. I’m
deeply grateful to receive this award as it serves as a reminder of those
who have walked this journey with me — those who encouraged, challenged,
and supported me in ways that allowed me to learn and lead with greater
purpose. This experience has also deepened my appreciation for the collective
effort behind every milestone. It is the persistence, generosity, and loyalty
of many—driven by a shared commitment to something greater—that empower
us to value the experience as much as we value the outcomes. That, to me,
is what makes this journey truly lasting.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>CHONG KAI XU</strong>
</p>
<p>I am extremely honoured to receive the Outstanding Leadership Award. Personally,
leadership is about bridging connections with people, journeying together
as one whilst uplifting others. Above all, leadership encompasses service
with loyalty, integrity, respect and humility whilst upholding one’s moral
values especially when faced with dilemmas. NJ has taught me how service
through the smallest actions, like being present for others to lending
a listening ear, goes a long way to make a difference in forging an inclusive
and united community which helps us to take bigger leaps together. Ultimately,
leadership is about willingly serving others around us no matter the size
of our actions, community and titles we hold. Although my journey was fraught
with challenges, I believe that these hurdles serve as learning opportunities
for me to learn and grow as a person. I am deeply thankful for the unwavering
support and dedication my teachers, friends and family have given me throughout
my 2 years in NJ. I am very grateful for the myriad of opportunities NJ
has given to me to serve the community in several ways. Looking back, my
time in NJ has been a fulfilling one filled with valuable lessons and countless
memories that I will forever treasure.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>NG XIN YI</strong>
</p>
<p>Receiving this award is a humbling honour. It reflects not just my personal
journey, but the collective strength of those I’ve led and learned from.
The leadership opportunities I’ve had at NJC have taught me that true leadership
isn’t about being in front—it’s about standing beside others, especially
when the stakes are high. As a captain, loyalty meant showing up consistently
for my team, not just during matches, but in early mornings, tough training
sessions, and difficult moments of self-doubt. It was about being a dependable
presence, someone my teammates could count on both on and off the field.
Integrity guided every decision I made. I learned that leadership isn’t
about giving orders, it’s about listening with empathy and making the right
choices, even when they’re difficult. Whether it meant taking responsibility
for my mistakes or standing up for what was fair, I aimed to lead in a
way that fostered trust and mutual respect. I truly resonate with the quote,
“The servant-leader is servant first. It begins with the natural feeling
that one wants to serve, to serve first.” If someone asks why I serve,
I can only say—I don’t know exactly. It’s just a feeling! And this feeling
has guided every step of my leadership journey in NJC.</p>
