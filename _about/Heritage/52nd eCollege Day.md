        <p> Mr. Ang Pow Chew <br>
<img src="/images/ecol2.png" style="width:283px;height:340px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> Our theme for College Day this year – “Steadfast, we forge ahead” – was decided after much discussion. We wanted a theme to reflect our resolve to overcome the challenges brought about by a tiny microbe that invaded and caused much misery throughout the world. “Steadfast” suggests a steady and unwavering conviction, and “forge ahead” implies taking the lead or making good progress. I am glad that my colleagues have been steadfast in ensuring that our school continues to be a safe and effective learning environment for NJCians. They have leveraged technology to design engaging e-lessons. They pressed on with CCA and VIA to allow NJCians to have as many experiences as were possible, given the challenging circumstances. In addition, my colleagues have forged ahead by redesigning programmes, including our international Science and Humanities fairs, such that these fairs were creatively held in the online space. The many schools, both local and international, participating in these fairs, reflected the success of the fairs. The Self Mastery Plus programme, started early this year, was a fruitful substitute for the boarding programme which could not be held because of the current circumstances. Without challenges, we can never know how steadfast we can be. There will be unforeseen circumstances but we must never stop forging ahead. Such circumstances are there to make us stronger and not to hold us down. So, “Steadfast, we forge head” we must. <br>

      <p> Steadfast, We Forge Ahead<br> <img src="/images/sf1.png" 
     style="width:60%"> <br> Steadfast, we forge ahead. Steadfast – an unwavering determination, taking one step at a time to progress forward. 2020 was a tough year for all of us, in many aspects. It has not been easy for the whole school community, adjusting to changes, and remaining resilient when challenged by uncertainties that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought. Many new acronyms and many new “norms” were imposed upon our generation of youths, whom despite all these, have adapted, innovated and emerged stronger. This embodies the spirit of being steadfast, pressing on regardless of the difficulties faced, the uncertainties that lurk, and the obstacles to surmount. 2020, a year to remember, a year that we overcame. Steadfast, we march forth stronger, and more determined than ever towards a better future. <br> <img src="/images/sf2.png"
