### Anthem and Song

#### Malay

Inilah maktab banggaan kita,  
Tempat pelajar segala bangsa;  
Diasuh dididik mencapai cita  
Satu negara neka budaya!

Di sini kita menuntut sama,  
Tanpa mengira kekasta bangsa;  
Bergerak maju berbuat jasa,  
Tetap berbakti jujur dan setia.

Marilah semua belia negara,  
Dengan semangat bakti semata;  
Satukan tenaga bertindak mara,  
Kita jayakan rakyat Singapura.

#### English

This is the College, our pride,  
A place for students of all races;  
Nurtured and educated to achieve the aim,  
Of one multi-cultural nation.

Here we learn together,  
Regardless of caste and race;  
(We) move forward in service,  
Constantly serving with sincerity and loyalty.

Come all youths of the nation,  
With a spirit of total dedication;  
By uniting our energy for progress,  
We lead the people of Singapore to success.

#### The National Dream

Building a family  
To answer a nationâ€™s calling;  
Students of old will always be  
The beacon in our dreams

The national torch; a stream of light  
We pass from year to year  
The best of the old  
And the best of the young,  
Prepare to serve and lead  
With common vision; aspiration,  
Strength from memories  
The national dream, fulfilled for all to see

Embracing our destiny  
Standing with colours blazing  
Shoulder to shoulder, friends are we  
Honoring our creed

The national torch; a stream of light  
We pass from year to year  
The best of the old and the best of the young  
Prepare to serve and lead  
With common vision; aspiration  
Strength from memories  
The national dream, fulfilled for all to see
