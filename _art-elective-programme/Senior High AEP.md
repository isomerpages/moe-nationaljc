There will be many opportunities for authentic, experiential and collaborative learning as part of the SH Art learning experience.

At the end of SH1, H2 Art students are also offered the opportunity to take H3 Art.

Students may approach any of the art tutors if they have any queries.

**Non-AEP students who would like to opt for Art may also apply for the subject at H2 level.
