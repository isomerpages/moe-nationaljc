### Art Elective Programme

![](/images/niche1.png)

**Creatives of Tomorrow:  
Care to Dream, Dare to Make**

**This is the mission of the National Junior College Art Elective Programme (AEP@NJC).**  
**AEP@NJC strives to nurture and develop passion, for those who wish to make a change in our future world.**

Established in 1985, the National Junior College Art Elective Programme champions creativity and innovation in artistic making and critical thinking. Students of this Programme follow a dynamic curriculum that has been developed and is constantly evolving, to remain aligned with the industry practices of the real world. Through a carefully designed six-year scheme of work, students embark on learning experiences that are anchored by phenomenon-based themes, essential questions and levels of innovation. These learning outcomes are mapped out for each year in the Developmental Levels of Study (see chart below).

Across all years of study from Junior High 1 to Senior High 2, students are also nurtured to build the competencies of critical thought and effective communication. In addition to the practical hands-on components of making, visual literacy is a core component of the Programme. This is enhanced with the learning experiences of reflective and responsive art writing, in-depth study of visual cultures, and critical discourse through discussions and debate.

Moreover, student outcomes of learning are assessed thoughtfully through a variety of modes in the areas of craft, concept and connection, both formatively and authentically. Project submissions, work proposals, open presentations, authentic showcases, real-world applications, and industry exposure are but a few of the key milestones that punctuate the six-year learning journey in the NJC Art Elective Programme.
